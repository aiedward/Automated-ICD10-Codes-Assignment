TI  - A 4 and a half years old boy with mesenchymal hamartomas in the left lateral lobe
      of the liver: A case report and literature review.

AB  - RATIONALE: Mesenchymal hamartomas of the liver is one type of rare liver tumor.
      PATIENT CONCERNS: Mesenchymal hamartomas of the liver (MHL) is rarely reported in
      the left lobe of the liver in children who are more than 2 years old. It is
      difficult to distinguish it from liver lesions such as hepatoblastoma in
      children, and hepatocellular carcinoma and focal nodular hyperplasia in adults.
      In addition, it is hard to correctly diagnose it without pathological
      examination. DIAGNOSES: Mesenchymal hamartomas of the liver. INTERVENTIONS: This 
      patient underwent an operation assisted by the Da Vinci surgical system and the
      tumor was completely resected. OUTCOMES: No tumor recurrence or metastasis was
      observed 14 months after operation. LESSONS: MHL is a benign tumor that is
      difficult to diagnose due to the lack of specific clinical symptoms and signs.
      The management of MHL remains controversial. To achieve a good long-term outcome,
      complete resection of MHL is recommended.

TI  - A novel KCNQ1 nonsense variant in the isoform-specific first exon causes both
      jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome 1 and long QT syndrome 1: a case report.
PG  - 66
LID - 10.1186/s12881-017-0430-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: According to previous KCNQ1 (potassium channel, voltage gated,
      KQT-like subfamily, member 1) gene screening studies, missense variants, but not 
      nonsense or frame-shift variants, cause the majority of long QT syndrome (LQTS;
      Romano-Ward syndrome [RWS]) 1 cases. Several missense variants are reported to
      cause RWS by a dominant-negative mechanism, and some KCNQ1 variants can cause
      both Jervell and Lange-Nielsen Syndrome (JLNS; in an autosomal recessive manner) 
      and LQTS1 (in an autosomal dominant manner), while other KCNQ1 variants cause
      only JLNS. The human KCNQ1 gene is known to have two transcript isoforms (kidney 
      isoform and pancreas isoform), and both isoforms can form a functional cardiac
      potassium channel. CASE PRESENTATION: Here, we report a novel nonsense KCNQ1
      variant causing not only JLNS, but also significant QTc prolongation identical to
      RWS in an autosomal dominant manner. Our case study supports that
      haploinsufficiency in the KCNQ1 gene is causative of significant QTc prolongation
      identical to RWS. Interestingly, the nonsense variant (NM_000218.2:c.115G > T
      [p.Glu39X]) locates in exon 1a of KCNQ1, which is a kidney-isoform specific exon.
      The variant is located closer to the N-terminus than previously identified
      nonsense or frame-shift variants. CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, this 
      is the first report showing that a nonsense variant in exon 1a of KCNQ1, which is
      the kidney-isoform specific exon, causes JLNS. Our findings may be informative to
      the genetic pathogenesis of RWS and JLNS caused by KCNQ1 variants.

TI  - Pruritic Urticarial Papules and Plaques of Pregnancy Occurring Postpartum Treated
      with Intramuscular Injection of Autologous Whole Blood.
PG  - 151-156
LID - 10.1159/000473874 [doi]
AB  - Pruritic urticarial papules and plaques of pregnancy (PUPPP) is one of the most
      common diseases associated with pregnancy. In most cases, the skin lesions
      develop in the third trimester of primigravidas. There are no systemic
      alterations seen in PUPPP; however, most patients report severe pruritus. A
      34-year-old woman presented 1 week postpartum with typical clinical features of
      PUPPP. The patient showed good response to intramuscular injection of autologous 
      whole blood with no adverse effects to the patient or her baby. Presentation of
      PUPPP in the postpartum period is rare. Conservative management with topical
      corticosteroids and oral antihistamines is commonly used to relieve pruritus. In 
      severe cases, skin lesions and symptoms are controlled with a brief course of
      systemic corticosteroids. Investigation of new treatment options has been limited
      by patient concerns about the negative effects of medication on the fetus or
      breastfeeding. Intramuscular injection of autologous whole blood could be an
      alternative treatment option for PUPPP, especially for women who worry about the 
      use of medications during pregnancy or breastfeeding.

PG  - e7003
LID - 10.1097/MD.0000000000007003 [doi]
AB  - RATIONALE: The optimal therapeutic regimen for primary malignant melanoma of the 
      esophagus (PMME) need to be further elucidated. Besides, the efficacy of surgery 
      for PMME with remote metastasis is uncertain for its rarity. PATIENT CONCERNS:
      Herein a previously healthy patient was admitted for dysphagia and fatigue,
      without significant weight loss. DIAGNOSES: The pathological and molecular tests 
      revealed his diagnosis of BRAF-mutant, advanced PMME with localized pulmonary
      metastasis. INTERVENTIONS: Single-stage Ivor-Lewis esophagectomy and lobectomy
      were performed successfully, followed by 4 cycles of conventional chemotherapy,
      and concurrent high-dose interferon lasting for 1 year. OUTCOMES: The patient
      survived without logo-regional recurrence or remote metastasis during the follow 
      up of two and a half years up to now. LESSONS: Timely resection of localized
      primary and metastatic lesions might deliver a chance to obtain better prognosis 
      for selected PMME patients; however, high-quality trials with longer follow-up
      are needed.

      bronchopleural fistula: A case report.
PG  - e6688
LID - 10.1097/MD.0000000000006688 [doi]
AB  - RATIONALE: Numerous types of flap coverage have been reported to prevent or to
      repair bronchopleural fistulas. Most of the flaps were harvested from chest area.
      However, these pedicled flaps might not be optimal for the patient who has
      undergone previous radiotherapy on pulmonary parenchyma because the pedicle
      artery of the flap might have been injured by irradiation. Therefore, an
      alternative flap outside of the chest area is necessary. PATIENT CONCERNS: A
      61-year-old male was diagnosed of squamous cell carcinoma in right upper lobe
      lung (cT3N2M0, stage IIIa). After completing the neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy,
      he underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery with right side
      intrapericardial pneumonectomy. DIAGNOSIS: Persistent air leak due to
      postpneumonectomy bronchopleural fistula. INTERVENTIONS: Pedicled transverse
      rectus abdominis myocutaneous (TRAM) flap was used to repair the bronchial stump.
      OUTCOMES: The bronchial stump was repaired successfully, the bronchopleural
      fistula was obliterated, and the patient was free from air leak after following
      for 12 months. LESSONS: This case demonstrated that pedicled TRAM flap is a
      feasible alternative to repair bronchopleural fistula.

TI  - US-guided percutaneous laser ablation of refractory metastatic retroperitoneal
      lesions: A care-compliant case report.
PG  - e6597
LID - 10.1097/MD.0000000000006597 [doi]
AB  - RATIONALE: Retroperitoneal metastatic lymph node is rare but severe, which has
      important structures like the gastrointestinal tract and large blood vessels
      around and may challenge excision, inducing serious complications like
      hemorrhage, intestinal adhesion, and even death after injury. PATIENT CONCERNS:
      We described the case of a 60-year-old man with a history of right liver
      resection in 2010, pulmonary wedge resection in 2012, and transarterial
      chemoembolization twice in 2014, in which the postoperative pathology suggested
      the mixed liver cancer, and poorly differentiated lung cancer from liver
      metastasis. DIAGNOSES: Preoperative magnetic resonance (MR) imaging scan showed a
      refractory retroperitoneal metastatic lymph node. INTERVENTIONS: Then this
      patient repeatedly received 4 ablations with US-guided laser ablation within a
      month. OUTCOMES: After 4 ablations due to residual tumor, MR, and CT images of
      5-month follow-up showed the partial response. No obvious side effects were
      discovered in this case during these procedures. LESSONS: This suggested
      US-guided laser ablation appears to be a useful technique for retroperitoneal
      metastatic lymph node with poor general condition or those refusing surgical
      therapy.

AB  - RATIONALE: Postoperative coma is not uncommon in patients after craniotomy. It
      generally presents as mental state changes and is usually caused by intracranial 
      hematoma, brain edema, or swelling. Hyperammonemia can also result in
      postoperative coma; however, it is rarely recognized as a potential cause in coma
      patients. Hyperammonemic coma is determined through a complicated differential
      diagnosis, and although it can also be induced as a side effect of valproate
      (VPA), this cause is frequently unrecognized or confused with upper
      gastrointestinal hemorrhage (UGH)-induced hepatic encephalopathy. We herein
      present a case of valproate-induced hyperammonemic encephalopathy (VHE) to
      illustrate the rarity of such cases and emphasize the importance of correct
      diagnosis and proper treatment. PATIENT CONCERNS AND DIAGNOSES: A 61-year-old
      woman with meningioma was admitted into our hospital. Radical resection of the
      tumor was performed, and the patient recovered well as expected. After
      administration of valproate for 7 days, the patient was suddenly found in a deep 
      coma, and her mental state deteriorated rapidly. The diagnoses of hepatic
      encephalopathy was confirmed. However, whether it origins from upper
      gastrointestinal hemorrhage or valproate side effect is uncertain. INTERVENTIONS 
      AND OUTCOMES: The patient's condition fluctuated without improvement during the
      subsequent 3 days under the treatment of reducing ammonia. With the
      discontinuation of valproate treatment, the patient regained complete
      consciousness within 48 hours, and her blood ammonia decreased to the normal
      range within 4 days. LESSONS SUBSECTIONS: VHE is a rare but serious complication 
      in patients after craniotomy and is diagnosed by mental state changes and
      elevated blood ammonia. Thus, the regular perioperative administration of VPA,
      which is frequently neglected as a cause of VHE, should be emphasized. In
      addition, excluding UGH prior to providing a diagnosis and immediately
      discontinuing VPA administration are recommended.

TI  - A case report of apatinib in treating osteosarcoma with pulmonary metastases.
PG  - e6578
LID - 10.1097/MD.0000000000006578 [doi]
AB  - RATIONALE: Osteosarcoma is the most common malignant bone tumor in children and
      adolescents. Pulmonary metastases lead to a significantly increased risk of
      death. Apatinib, a new potent oral small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor
      targeting the intracellular domain of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor
      2 (VEGFR-2), shows survival benefits in treating advanced or metastatic gastric
      adenocarcinoma, non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer and metastatic breast
      cancer. However, its efficacy in metastatic osteosarcoma has not been reported
      yet. PATIENT CONCERNS: Herein, we presented a 50-year-old man patient who visited
      hospital due to local bone pain in the left leg. DIAGNOSES: He was initially
      diagnosed with osteoblastic osteosarcoma. INTERVENTIONS: The patient suffered
      repeated resection surgeries but developed multiple lung metastases. Positive
      staining for CD31, CD34, and VEGFR-2 were detected in the tumor section. As he
      refused to receive chemotherapy due to concerns regarding the chemotherapy
      toxicities and sorafenib due to high cost, apatinib was given at a dose of 500 mg
      daily. OUTCOMES: Eleven months following apatinib administration, the patient
      achieved a partial response according to the RECIST 1.1 standard. No severe
      toxicity or drug-related side effect was observed during the treatment. LESSONS: 
      Therefore, apatinib could be a new option for the treatment of metastatic
      osteosarcoma. Clinical trials are required to further confirm the efficacy and
      safety of apatinib in treating pulmonary metastases from osteosarcoma.

AB  - RATIONALE: Melanoma metastases to the pituitary adenoma (MMPA) are extremely
      rare, with only 1 reported case. To date, the melanoma metastasis to the existing
      prolactinoma has not been reported in literatures. PATIENT CONCERNS: We report a 
      case of 62-year-old woman presented with progressive visual disturbance and
      hyperprolactinemia. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated the presence of a
      round sellar mass. DIAGNOSES: Melanoma metastasis to the pituitary adenoma.
      INTERVENTIONS: Surgery was performed and intraoperative frozensection examination
      found melanin granules and histopathological examination confirmed melanoma
      metastasis to the pituitary adenoma. OUTCOMES: After surgery, the patient
      developed widespread melanoma metastasis to lower limbs. Twenty-two months later,
      the patient was alive with worse symptoms. LESSONS: We reviewed and analyzed the 
      clinical data, imaging features, and treatment methods of other reported cases of
      metastases to pituitary adenoma (MPA). This study provides clinical information
      for the diagnosis and management of MMPA.

AB  - RATIONALE: Nocardia species are aerobic saprophytic bacilli. Among Nocardia
      species, Nocardia otitidiscaviarum (N otitidiscaviarum) is rarely reported in
      pulmonary infection. PATIENT CONCERNS: We reported a case of N otitidiscaviarum
      pneumonia in a cotton farmer. DIAGNOSES: N otitidiscaviarum pneumonia was
      identified by mass spectroscopy. INTERVENTIONS: Combined treatments (amikacin,
      imipenem and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) were administered after
      identification of N otitidiscaviarum. OUTCOMES: The patient eventually died from 
      severe respiratory insufficiency in the hospital. LESSONS: Early precise
      diagnosis and prompt combined therapy are of vital importance in severe Nocardia 
      pulmonary infection.

TI  - A case report of PVOD patient combined with pulmonary embolism: Anticoagulation
      or not?
PG  - e6507
LID - 10.1097/MD.0000000000006507 [doi]
AB  - RATIONALE: Pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD) is a rare form of pulmonary
      arterial hypertension (PAH). Oral anticoagulation is confined to patients with
      idiopathic PAH (IPAH), but no oral anticoagulation has been recommended for PVOD,
      because occult pulmonary hemorrhage was a common finding in PVOD. PATIENT
      CONCERNS: We report a case of PVOD, who was misdiagnosed as IPAH for 5 years with
      worsening dyspnea and two episodes of pulmonary embolism (PE). DIAGNOSES: He was 
      confirmed as PVOD combined with PE by biopsy of the explanted lung specimen.
      INTERVENTIONS: He took oral anticoagulation, warfarin, to treat his first-time PE
      in July 2010, and his disease was kept stable for about 4 years, until he
      discontinued the anticoagulation therapy by himself sometime in 2014. Later on, a
      life-threatening PE recurred in January 2015, so he resumed the anticoagulation
      therapy. OUTCOMES: Fortunately, the bilateral sequential lung transplantation
      that was performed in July 2015 in time saved his life. He has been living well
      without dyspnea and the echocardiography showed the normalizations of the once
      increased pulmonary arterial pressure and the once enlarged right ventricle of
      his heart. In addition, to the best of my knowledge, he was the first PVOD
      patient receiving lung transplantation in China. LESSONS: We recommend that PVOD 
      patients combined with PE should be treated with anticoagulation therapy
      indefinitely to prevent the recurrence of life-threatening PE until they get a
      chance for lung transplantation.

      Clinical case report.
PG  - e6493
LID - 10.1097/MD.0000000000006493 [doi]
AB  - RATIONALE: Hypophosphatemic osteomalacia (HO) is a metabolic bone disease,
      exhibiting different etiologies such as genetic mutation, tumor induction,
      dysimmunity, or renal disease. Sjogren's syndrome (SS) is a connective tissue
      disorder commonly involving exocrine glands; however kidney involvement is also
      encountered, leading to abnormal phosphorus metabolism, even HO. PATIENT
      CONCERNS: A 47-year-old female patient presented progressively worsening pain in 
      the chest wall, back and bilateral lower extremities as well as muscle weakness
      was referred to our department. DIAGNOSES, INTERVENTIONS AND OUTCOMES: Due to the
      laboratory test results, radiographic findings and pathologic results, she was
      diagnosed with adult-onset HO associated with SS. She was then treated with
      alkalinization, steroids, neutral phosphate, calcium supplements together with
      activated vitamin D. So far, she recovered uneventfully with relieved pain and
      increased serum phosphorus level. LESSONS: HO may be secondary to renal tubular
      acidosis of SS patients, and it might be a diagnostic challenge when the kidney
      involvement in SS is latent and precede the typical sicca symptoms.

      review of literature.
PG  - e6478
LID - 10.1097/MD.0000000000006478 [doi]
AB  - RATIONALE: Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma is a low grade
      malignant B cell lymphoma which occurs mainly in the organs having mucosal layer.
      Though gastrointestinal tract is the most commonly involved extranodal site,
      primary esophageal MALT lymphoma is very rare with less than 20 cases reported in
      literature. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 75-year-old man was referred to our hospital for 
      evaluation of dysphagia. Endoscopy revealed a submucosal tumor located in the
      middle and lower third of esophagus. CT chest and endoscopic ultrasound revealed 
      a 15.5 x 5.9 x 4.0 cm well circumscribed submucosa esophageal tumor. Test for
      serum antibody against H. pylori was negative. Due to the large tumor size,
      patient underwent surgical resection. Histological examination showed a
      submucosal tumor consisting of multiple nodules of varying sizes with intact
      covering squamous epithelium. The nodules were mainly composed of diffusely and
      monoclonal proliferating centrocyte-like or monocyte-like cells. Follicular
      colonizations were observed without lymphoepithelial lesions. The tumor cells
      were diffusely positive for CD20, PAX-5, Bcl-2 and follicular dendritic cells
      were positive for CD21, CD23. Monoclonal gene rearrangement was positive for
      immunoglobulin heavy chain gene, Kappa light chain gene and Lambda light chain
      gene. DIAGNOSES: Based on these findings, final diagnosis of esophageal MALT
      lymphoma was made. OUTCOMES: At 8 month follow up, no recurrence or metastases
      was detected. LESSONS: Esophageal MALT lymphoma is a rare disease with definitive
      diagnosis possible only after histopathological examination. It carries good
      prognosis due to low malignant potential.

TI  - Case report and systematic literature review of a novel etiology of sinistral
      portal hypertension presenting with UGI bleeding: Left gastric artery
      pseudoaneurysm compressing the splenic vein treated by embolization of the
      pseudoaneurysm.
PG  - e6413

AB  - INTRODUCTION: A novel case is reported of upper gastrointestinal (UGI) bleeding
      from sinistral portal hypertension, caused by a left gastric artery (LGA)
      pseudoaneurysm (PA) compressing the splenic vein (SV) that was successfully
      treated with PA embolization. CASE REPORT: A 41-year-old man with previous
      medical history of recurrent, alcoholic pancreatitis presented with several
      episodes of hematemesis and abdominal pain for 48 hours. Physical examination
      revealed a soft abdomen, with no abdominal bruit, no pulsatile abdominal mass,
      and no stigmata of chronic liver disease. The hemoglobin declined acutely from
      12.3 to 9.3 g/dL. Biochemical parameters of liver function and routine
      coagulation profile were entirely within normal limits. Abdominal CT revealed a
      5-cm-wide peripancreatic mass compressing the stomach and constricting the SV.
      Esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed blood oozing from portal hypertensive
      gastropathy, small nonbleeding gastric cardial and fundal varices, gastric
      compression from the extrinsic mass, and no esophageal varices. MRCP and
      angiography showed that the mass was vascular, arose from the LGA, compressed the
      mid SV without SV thrombosis, and caused sinistral portal hypertension. At
      angiography, the PA was angioembolized and occluded. The patient has been
      asymptomatic with no further bleeding and a stable hemoglobin level during 8
      weeks of follow-up. DISCUSSION: Literature review of the 14 reported cases of LGA
      PA revealed that this report of acute UGI bleeding from sinistral portal
      hypertension from a LGA PA constricting the SV is novel; one previously reported 
      patient had severe anemia without acute UGI bleeding associated with sinistral
      portal hypertension from a LGA PA. CONCLUSION: A patient presented with UGI
      bleeding from sinistral portal hypertension from a LGA PA compressing the SV that
      was treated by angiographic obliteration of the PA which relieved the SV
      compression and arrested the UGI bleeding. Primary therapy for this syndrome
      should be addressed to obliterate the PA and not the secondarily constricted SV.

TI  - Combination of laparoscope and choledochoscope to treat biliary ascariasis: A
      CARE-compliant case report.
PG  - e6291
LID - 10.1097/MD.0000000000006291 [doi]
AB  - RATIONALE: Ascariasis is an endemic parasitic disease caused by Ascaris
      lumbricoides, which severely burdens the healthcare system as well as harms the
      personal life quality, especially among less developed regions. Biliary
      ascariasis is a critical complication of intestinal ascariasis with painful and
      life-threatening manifestations. The exploration of proper strategies as its
      medical interventions remains largely controversial. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 16
      year-old patient complained of abdominal pain and yellow sclera. DIAGNOSES:
      Biliary ascariasis INTERVENTIONS:: Laparoscopic cholecystectomy and bile duct
      exploration. OUTCOMES: More than one hundred ascarids were extracted and the
      patient had been discharged from hospital without any complications. LESSONS: The
      combination of laparoscope and choledochoscope is an efficient method to treat
      biliary ascariasis, despite of large worm burden in the common bile duct.

      literature.
PG  - e6173
LID - 10.1097/MD.0000000000006173 [doi]
AB  - RATIONALE: Solid organ transplant recipients, especially after lung
      transplantation, are at increased risk for Mycobacterium tuberculosis pulmonary
      tuberculosis due to lifelong immunosuppression. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 41-year-old
      woman underwent a second bilateral lung transplantation that was complicated by
      fatal pulmonary tuberculosis. DIAGNOSES: Histological examination of a lung
      biopsy performed 6 weeks after retransplantation revealed a caseating granuloma
      and necrosis. Acid-fast bacilli were identified as rifampicin-susceptible M.
      tuberculosis by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), confirmed by culture 2
      weeks later. INTERVENTIONS: Our investigation led us to highly suspect that the
      transplanted lungs were the source of M. tuberculosis transmission. LESSONS: In
      order to optimize diagnosis and treatment for lung recipients with latent or
      active tuberculosis, regular assessment of lower respiratory samples for M.
      tuberculosis, particularly during the 12-month period posttransplant should be
      implemented. Regarding donor-derived transmission, screening donor grafts with
      latent tuberculosis by M. tuberculosis real-time PCR in lymphoid and adipose
      tissues is an option that should be considered.

      requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation with rapid multiorgan relapse: A
      case report.
PG  - e6024
LID - 10.1097/MD.0000000000006024 [doi]
AB  - RATIONALE: Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) is an antineutrophil
      cytoplasmatic antibodies (ANCA)-associated vasculitis affecting small- and
      medium-sized blood vessels, mostly involving lung and kidney. PATIENT CONCERNS:
      We report the case of a 33-year-old man that presented with acute respiratory
      distress syndrome caused by alveolar hemorrhage. DIAGNOSES: Aggressive GPA
      presenting with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage and multiorgan involvement.
      INTEVENTIONS: Immunosuppressive therapy, plasma exchange, extracorporeal membrane
      oxygenation (ECMO). OUTCOMES: Relapse occurred very early, despite
      immunosuppressive treatment, with a rare involvement of genital system
      (epididymitis) and rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis difficult to treat.
      LESSONS: GPA is a challenging, multifaceted disease that can require aggressive
      supportive therapy and is associated with a high rate of relapse that may present
      with uncommon site of involvement.

      pleural mass invading her left chest wall with rib destruction and pleural
      effusion. CT-guided needle biopsy revealed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.
      Low-dose oral etoposide produced a complete response, and she continued oral
      chemotherapy for one year after the diagnosis and maintained good performance
      status. We herein report a very rare case of non-pyothorax-associated lymphoma
      that nonetheless resulted in great recovery.

TI  - Malignant gastrointestinal neuroectodermal tumor: a case report and review of the
      literature.
PG  - 29
LID - 10.1186/s13000-017-0620-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Malignant gastrointestinal neuroectodermal tumor (GNET) is an
      extremely rare entity that was first described by Zambrano et al. in 2003 as
      "Clear cell sarcoma-like tumor of the gastrointestinal tract". It shares some of 
      the histological features of clear cell sarcoma (CCS) but lacks the
      immunohistochemical reactivity for melanocytic markers. We report a case of GNET 
      that was initially misdiagnosed as gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST).
      Recognizing this entity is important to avoid misdiagnosis. CASE PRESENTATION: A 
      case of an 18-year-old male presented with a small intestinal tumor.
      Histologically it was characterized by polygonal cells arranged in pseudoalveolar
      pattern and situated in the muscularis propria. Scattered osteoclast-like
      multinucleated giant cells were also noted. The neoplastic cells were positive
      for S-100 protein and negative for HMB-45, Melan A, smooth muscle actin, desmin
      and CD117. EWSR1 gene rearrangement was detected by fluorescence in situ
      hybridization (FISH) analysis. The patient returned with recurrence after 36
      months' management by surgical resection and died one year later. CONCLUSIONS:
      GNET can be mistaken histologically for other non-epithelial gastrointestinal
      tumors. Awareness of its existence and diagnostic criteria by the pathologist is 
      necessary to avoid misdiagnosis, particularly as GIST, CCS or malignant
      peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST).

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a subtype of non-Hodgkin B-cell
      lymphoma, accounting for 6% of all non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The typical appearance
      of intestinal MCL is multiple lymphomatous polyposis, whereas presentation as
      protruding lesions is uncommon. We herein report the case of a 64-year-old male
      patient who was admitted to our hospital with epigastric pains. On endoscopy,
      submucosal neoplasma were identified in the gastric antrum, the duodenal bulb,
      and the rectum. On endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) (OLYMPUS EUS EU-ME2,
      Miniprobe sonography), the lesions were homogeneously hypoechoic and originated
      from the submucous layer or muscularis mucosa. Pathological examination of
      biopsied specimens from the lesions of the rectum revealed diffuse lymphomatous
      proliferation and dense infiltration by monomorphic and small cleaved cells with 
      irregularly shaped nuclei. On immunohistochemistry, the cells were positive for
      cyclin D1, CD20, CD21, SOX-11, and Bcl-2, but negative for CD3 and CD10; these
      findings were compatible with a diagnosis of MCL. CONCLUSION: The EUS
      characteristics initially led to the suspicion of digestive neuroendocrine
      tumors, since MCL presenting as submucosal tumors on EUS is rarely reported. We
      herein present this case to suggest clinician to include MCL in the differential 
      diagnosis of submucosal intestinal lesions, as early diagnosis and timely
      treatment may improve patient prognosis.

AB  - Portal vein aneurysms are extremely rare, less than 200 cases have been reported 
      until late 2015. They are defined as a portal vein diameter exceeding 19 mm for
      cirrhotic patients and 15 mm in normal livers. Most patients are asymptomatic,
      but complications may occur. We report a case of a 68-year-old female admitted
      for etiological assessment of a portal hypertension revealed by an upper gastro
      intestinal bleeding, who was incidentally diagnosed with a portal vein aneurysm.

TI  - Unusual cause of 55 years of rectal bleeding: hemolymphangioma (a case report).
PG  - e6264
LID - 10.1097/MD.0000000000006264 [doi]
AB  - RATIONALE: Hemolymphangioma is a rare developmental error of combined blood and
      lymphatic vasculature. To the best of our knowledge, there is only one case of
      rectal hemolymphangioma reported in Pubmed. Our case probably is the first
      reported rectal hemolymphangioma with computed tomography (CT) evaluation.
      PATIENT CONCERNS AND DIAGNOSIS: A 57-year-old male was presented to our hospital 
      with 55 years of long history of episodic rectal bleeding. Past medical history
      showed numerous hospital visits for similar illness. Multiple diagnoses were made
      and different treatment modalities were applied for his benefit, but none of them
      relieved the symptoms permanently. He was then referred to our hospital. On
      admission, he was presented with intermediate rectal bleeding of fresh blood. CT 
      examination showed isodense homogenous rectal wall thickening with heterogeneous 
      enhancement on contrast examination. Multiple calcifications were seen in and
      around the lesion. INTERVENTIONS AND OUTCOMES: He underwent open abdominal
      surgery with total surgical excision of the lesion. Post-surgical
      histopathological examination of excised specimen showed submucosal multiple
      thin-walled vessel of varying size, some consistent with blood vessel and other
      with lymph vessel, thus diagnosis of hemolymphangioma was made. Follow-up for 6
      months showed no recurrence. LESSIONS: Hemolymphangioma is a benign developmental
      lesion. Radiological findings can be challenging and range from benign cystic
      lesion to aggressive lesion mimicking malignancy. Therefore, combined clinical
      history, radiological findings, and continuous follow-up can help make proper
      diagnosis and provide prompt and accurate treatment.

TI  - Genetic characterization drives personalized therapy for early-stage
      non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients and survivors with metachronous
      second primary tumor (MST): A case report.
PG  - e6221
LID - 10.1097/MD.0000000000006221 [doi]
AB  - RATIONALE: The pathogenesis and progression of lung cancer is a complicated
      process in which many genes take part. But molecular gene testing is typically
      only performed in advanced-stage non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
      The value of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) administration is not widely
      recognized with respect to early-stage NSCLC. PATIENT CONCERNS: Here, we present 
      a case of a man, heavy smoker who initially presented with stage IA lung
      adenocarcinoma (LADC). Three years after a lung lobectomy, he was diagnosed with 
      advanced lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), according to laboratory, imaging,
      and pathological examinations. DIAGNOSES: The case initially had an early-stage
      LADC with an L858R epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation. A subsequent
      advanced SCC bearing EGFR L858R/T790M mutations occurred 3 years after surgery.
      INTERVENTIONS: The comprehensive therapy we utilized, including surgical
      resection for the early-stage lesion and GP chemotherapy and local radiotherapy
      as the first line therapy along with gefitinib maintenance treatment for the
      advanced metachronous second primary tumors (MST). OUTCOMES: The synthetical
      therapy, have resulted in our patient with remaining alive and progression free
      for 4.5 years. LESSONS: This case suggests that changes in molecular pathology
      should be monitored closely throughout cancer progression to guide personalized
      therapy and improve prognosis. We further review administration of TKI to
      early-stage NSCLC and to the metachronous second primary tumors (MST) in
      survivors.

      Cell Neuroendocrine Carcinoma of the Thymus.
PG  - 551-555
LID - 10.2169/internalmedicine.56.7655 [doi]
AB  - We herein report the case of a 44-year-old man who was diagnosed with
      pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) concomitant with ectopic adrenocorticotropic hormone
      (ACTH) syndrome, which had been caused by a large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma
      of the thymus. Chest computed tomography revealed ground-glass opacities in the
      lungs. PCP was diagnosed by a polymerase chain reaction with bronchoalveolar
      lavage. The levels of cortisol were slowly corrected with an adrenal enzyme
      inhibitor, and the exacerbation of PCP was successfully avoided. Our case
      indicates that in addition to prophylaxis, the early diagnosis of PCP and the
      slow correction of hypercortisolemia should be considered in order to prevent an 
      exacerbation due to the reconstitution of the immune function in patients with
      ectopic ACTH syndrome.

TI  - Chronic Myeloid Leukemia Associated Hypercalcemia: A Case Report and Literature
      Review.
PG  - 203-207
AB  - BACKGROUND Hypercalcemia associated with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is an
      ominous sign. Although rare, several cases have been reported and multiple
      pathophysiologic mechanisms have been independently proposed. We present a
      patient case and a literature review of the clinical presentation and mechanisms 
      of CML-associated hypercalcemia. CASE REPORT A 58-year-old male with a past
      medical history of CML diagnosed six years earlier, presented to the emergency
      department with one week of acute confusion, disorientation, polyuria, and
      polydipsia. On physical examination, we observed tachycardia, altered mental
      status, and dehydration. Blood analysis revealed leukocytosis, thrombocytosis,
      and marked hypercalcemia (18.6 mg/dL). His chest CT scan showed diffuse lytic
      lesions and bone destruction concerning for diffuse bone marrow involvement. The 
      patient was diagnosed with hypercalcemia in the context of a CML blast phase.
      Treatment with hydration, calcitonin, and zoledronic acid lead to control of his 
      symptoms and normalization of his serum calcium levels. After discharged, the
      patient was maintained on palliative treatment and zoledronic acid management
      without new episodes of hypercalcemia. However, eight months later, the patient
      died. CONCLUSIONS Evidence from the literature demonstrates a highly variable
      clinical presentation of CML-associated hypercalcemia, commonly occurring during 
      an accelerated or a blast phase, and associated with poor survival. Multiple
      mechanisms could be involved and are not exclusive of each other. Better
      understanding of the pathophysiologic mechanisms involved in CML-associated
      hypercalcemia could lead to improvement in clinical and laboratory evaluation of 
      these patients and be the foundation for the development of better management
      strategies and possibly target-directed therapy to positively improve prognosis.

AB  - Jarcho-Levin syndrome is a rare disorder characterised by defects in vertebral
      and costal segmentation of varying severity. Respiratory complications are the
      main cause of death or severe comorbidity due to a restrictive rib cage. A 3
      months old infant with Spondylocostal dysostosis and associated bronchomalacia
      experiencing severe asynchrony during the weaning process is reported. The
      Neurally Adjusted Ventilatory Assist (NAVA) mode was used to improve adaptation
      to mechanical ventilation after Vertical Expandable Prosthetic Titanium Ribs
      (VEPTRs) were implanted. The synchrony achieved with the NAVA mode allowed a
      decrease of the sedoanalgesia he received. A follow-up CT scan showed a reduction
      in the volume of the posterobasal atelectasis. The evolution of this patient
      suggests that the combined use of VEPTR for thoracic expansion and ventilation
      using NAVA can favour the global improvement. This mode could be an option to
      consider in selected patients with difficult weaning from mechanical ventilation 
      in paediatric intensive care units.

TI  - Helicobacter cinaedi bacteremia with cellulitis in a living-donor kidney
      transplant recipient identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization
      time-of-flight mass spectrometry: a case report.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Helicobacter cinaedi causes bacteremia and cellulitis, mainly in
      immunocompromised patients. We report a rare case of H. cinaedi bacteremia with
      cellulitis in a living-donor kidney transplant recipient identified by
      matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry
      (MALDI-TOF MS). A 54-year-old Asian man with IgA nephropathy underwent
      living-donor kidney transplantation 14 years previously. He was admitted to our
      hospital for evaluation of fever and multifocal cellulitis. H. cinaedi was
      isolated and identified from the patient's blood using matrix-assisted laser
      desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry and gyrase subunit
      B-targeted polymerase chain reaction assays. Matrix-assisted laser desorption
      ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry has proven over the years to be a
      rapid and accurate universal method for the identification of microorganisms.
      CONCLUSIONS: The combined use of these detection methods enabled the appropriate 
      administration of 6 weeks of antibiotic therapy. The patient recovered
      completely, with no recurrence.

AB  - Symptomatic Meckel's Diverticulum is a rare entity in old patients. The most
      common complications are gastrointestinal bleeding, intestinal obstruction, acute
      inflammation, and perforation. Usually those complications occur on the first two
      decades of life and mostly before the fifth decade. We report an extremely
      unusual debut of Meckel's Diverticulum, presented as massive spontaneous
      hemoperitoneum in an 82-year-old man without gastrointestinal bleeding. A
      literature review of atraumatic hemoperitoneum as presentation of Meckel's
      diverticulum was made.

AB  - A 73-year-old man with type 2 diabetes mellitus and end-stage renal disease was
      diagnosed with acute myocardial infarction. He required continuous dialysis after
      percutaneous coronary intervention. Subsequently, multiple nodules were
      discovered in both lungs for the first time, and Cryptococcus neoformans was
      isolated from the patient's sputum, blood, bilateral pleural fluid, and
      cerebrospinal fluid cultures, resulting in a diagnosis of disseminated
      cryptococcosis. This case represents an invaluable example of disseminated
      cryptococcosis with rapidly growing lung nodules in a dialysis patient, and
      illustrates that dialysis causes innate immune disorder and the reactivation of
      cryptococcosis.

TI  - Modified posterior vertebral column resection for Kummell disease: Case report.
PG  - e5955
LID - 10.1097/MD.0000000000005955 [doi]
AB  - RATIONALE: Kummell's disease is defined as delayed traumatic vertebral collapse
      disease in which patients develop a kyphosis after asymptomatic minor spinal
      trauma. Both anterior approach and posterior approach have been reported,
      however, there is no standard treatment for Kummell's disease. PATIENT CONCERNS: 
      We described a successful modified posterior vertebral column resection in a
      patient with Kummell's disease. A 65-year-old woman reported persistent back pain
      for almost three months. DIAGNOSES: Kummell's disease was diagnosed based on
      computer tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). INTERVENTIONS:
      Modified posterior vertebral column resection combined with short-segment
      fixation was designed to treat this disease. OUTCOMES: The procedure was
      successful without any complications. Patient reported that symptoms were
      obviously improved in one week after operation. LESSONS: Modified posterior
      vertebral column resection combined with short-segment fixation is an effective
      treatment option for Kummell's disease.

AB  - RATIONALE: Pseudoprogression, that is, initial tumor growth followed by
      subsequent tumor regression, has been well described for immunomodulation therapy
      in melanoma patients. This phenomenon is not well defined in lung cancer.
      Nivolumab, an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody, was recently approved for nonsmall
      cell lung cancer (NSCLC) as a second-line therapy. PATIENT CONCERNS AND
      DIAGNOSIS: We present a patient with squamous NSCLC, suffering from multiple bone
      and subcutaneous metastases. INTERVENTIONS: The patient was treated with
      nivolumab. OUTCOMES: A subcutaneous lesion in her upper back grew substantially
      after the first cycle of nivolumab, and later regressed, with marked improvement 
      in all cancer sites. LESSONS: Such pseudoprogression may serve to predict
      subsequent clinical response.

TI  - Iatrogenic Subclavian Artery Perforation Rescued by Operator-Modified Graft
      Stent.
PG  - 462-466
LID - 10.3349/ymj.2017.58.2.462 [doi]
AB  - Subclavian artery (SCA) perforation is a rare complication while performing SCA
      intervention. In our present report, a 73-year-old female, with stenosis of the
      left SCA and situs inversus, presented with exercise-induced left arm weakness.
      The SCA stenosis was treated with direct stenting with a balloon-expansible
      Express LD 10x25 mm stent. However, it caused iatrogenic SCA perforation and
      hemothorax. The perforation was sealed by endovascular repair with
      operator-modified Endurant II graft stent, which complicated with occlusion of
      left common carotid artery. And, the carotid artery was rescued by another stent.
      The graft stent, which was originally designed for abdominal aortic aneurysm, can
      be modified to suitable length and take as a rescue stent of large vessel with
      iatrogenic perforation. Due to strong radial force of graft stent, preservation
      of large side branches should been watched out.

TI  - Pulmonary Air Embolism: An Infrequent Complication in the Radiology Suite.
PG  - 80-84
AB  - BACKGROUND Air embolism can occur in a number of medical-surgical situations.
      Venous air embolism is frequently lethal when a substantial amount enters the
      venous circulation rapidly and can lead to significant morbidity if crossover to 
      the systemic arterial circulation occurs. The diagnosis of massive air embolism
      is usually made on clinical grounds by the development of abrupt hemodynamic
      compromise. The true incidence, morbidity, and mortality of this event is unknown
      given the difficulties in diagnosis. CASE REPORT An inadvertent antecubital
      venous injection of 150 mL of air using a contrast power injector during a
      computed tomography (CT) is reported. Immediate imaging (CT) showed a significant
      amount of air in the right atrium and right ventricular cavity, and air mixed
      with contrast in the main pulmonary artery and proximal divisions of the
      pulmonary circulation. Patient condition deteriorated requiring mechanical
      ventilation for 48 hours. Condition improved over the next few days and patient
      was successfully extubated and discharged home. CONCLUSIONS Air embolism is a
      rare complication, the potential for this to be life threatening makes prevention
      and early detection of this condition essential. This condition should be
      suspected when patients experience sudden onset respiratory distress and/or
      experience a neurological event in the setting of a known risk factor. Treatment 
      options include Durant's maneuver; left-lateral decubitus, head-down positioning;
      to decrease air entry into the right ventricle outflow tract, hyperbaric therapy,
      100% O2 and supportive care.

TI  - Combination therapy in a patient with chronic neuronopathic Gaucher disease: a
      case report.
PG  - 19
LID - 10.1186/s13256-016-1147-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The variants of neuronopathic Gaucher disease may be viewed as a
      clinical phenotypic continuum divided into acute and chronic forms. The chronic
      neuronopathic form of Gaucher disease is characterized by a later onset of
      neurological symptoms and protracted neurological and visceral involvement. The
      first-choice treatment for nonneuronopathic Gaucher disease is enzyme replacement
      therapy with recombinant analogues of the deficient human enzyme
      glucocerebrosidase. Enzyme replacement therapy has been shown to improve
      hematological and bone manifestations associated with Gaucher disease, but, as
      with most proteins, recombinant enzymes cannot cross the blood-brain barrier,
      which prevents effects on neurological manifestations. Substrate reduction
      therapy with miglustat (N-butyldeoxynojirimycin) inhibits glucosylceramide
      synthase, which catalyzes the first step in glycosphingolipid synthesis. Because 
      miglustat can cross the blood-brain barrier, it has been suggested that, combined
      with enzyme replacement therapy, it might be effective in treating neurological
      symptoms in patients with neuronopathic Gaucher disease. CASE PRESENTATION: We
      report observed effects of combined enzyme replacement therapy and substrate
      reduction therapy in a 7-year-old Caucasian boy with neuronopathic Gaucher
      disease who was homozygous for L444P mutations. He had received enzyme
      replacement therapy from the age of 18 months, and concomitant miglustat
      treatment was commenced, with dosing according to body surface area uptitrated
      over 1 month with dietary modifications when he reached the age of 30 months. He 
      experienced mild diarrhea after commencing miglustat therapy, which decreased in 
      frequency/severity over time. His splenomegaly was reduced, and his hematological
      values and plasma angiotensin-converting enzyme activity normalized. Plasma
      chitotriosidase also showed substantial and sustained decreases. After 5 years of
      combination therapy, the patient showed no signs of neurological impairment.
      CONCLUSIONS: This case supports the concept that oral miglustat in combination
      with intravenous enzyme replacement therapy may be beneficial in preventing
      neurological signs in patients with chronic neuronopathic Gaucher disease. The
      importance of dietary modifications has also been confirmed. Further follow-up
      studies are needed to better define the therapeutic effect of combined treatment 
      in this Gaucher disease subtype.

      case report.
PG  - 47
LID - 10.1186/s13104-016-2370-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Adenovirus is a common pathogen of acute upper respiratory infection 
      in children and is generally self-limiting. Severe adenovirus infections have
      been reported in immunocompromised hosts especially bone marrow transplantation
      recipients due to hematologic malignancy. Severe adenovirus pneumonia in
      immunocompetent hosts has rarely been reported and optimal treatment has not been
      established. We report a case of community-acquired severe adenovirus pneumonia
      which was successfully treated with early administration of oral ribavirin. CASE 
      PRESENTATION: A 39 year-old, previously healthy Korean male was admitted with
      symptoms of cough, myalgia, febrile sensation. Laboratory findings revealed that 
      he had hypoxemia, thrombocytopenia and elevated transaminase. Chest imaging
      showed a consolidation with pleural effusion, which was rapidly progressed. All
      microbiological tests were negative except multiplex real-time reverse
      transcriptase polymerase chain reaction using respiratory specimen, which was
      positive for human adenovirus. Under the diagnosis of severe adenovirus
      pneumonia, we started oral ribavirin, which results in complete recovery without 
      any complications. CONCLUSIONS: This case demonstrates that oral ribavirin,
      instead of other expensive antiviral treatment, could be a good therapeutic
      option for the severe adenovirus pneumonia at least occurred in immunocompetent
      hosts.

TI  - Solitary fibrous tumour of the liver-report on metastasis and local recurrence of
      a malignant case and review of literature.
PG  - 27
LID - 10.1186/s12957-017-1102-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Solitary fibrous tumours (SFT) are neoplasms of mesenchymal origin
      that predominantly arise from the pleura. SFT of the liver (SFTL) are a rare
      occurrence with little number of cases reported in English literature. Malignant 
      cases of hepatic SFT are an even rarer occurrence. For this reason, the
      prognostic evaluation of SFTLs is unknown and difficult to measure. METHODS: A
      search on English literature on "Solitary Fibrous Tumour of the Liver" was
      conducted on common search engines (PubMed, Google). All published articles, case
      reports and literature reviews and their reference lists were reviewed. CASE
      REPORT: This paper presents a 61-year-old male who was referred to a tertiary
      hospital in April 2010 with marked hepatomegaly. USS, CT and MRI scans were
      suggestive of a neoplasm, and the patient underwent a subsegmental IVb resection 
      in June 2010. The specimen demonstrated histological and immunohistochemical
      features of malignant SFTL with clear resection margins. The patient was followed
      up regularly for 3 years with imaging and no suggestion of recurrence. Six years 
      after the initial surgery, the patient represented with worsening right upper
      quadrant pain and dyspnoea secondary to extensive tumour recurrence adjacent to
      the resection site and metastatic deposits in the pleura. The patient was managed
      symptomatically and discharged for community follow-up after palliative
      involvement. CONCLUSIONS: SFTL are rare with only 84 cases reported in the
      English Literature including the present case. The average age of patients is
      57.1 and occurs in females more than males (1.4:1). Most SFTLs follow a benign
      course, however, 17.9% of cases displayed malignant histological features. Only
      three cases including the current case are reported to have both local recurrence
      and metastasis. Surgical resection remains the mainstay of treatment and appears 
      to be curative of most cases. The rarity of this tumour makes it difficult to
      evaluate its prognosis and natural course.

LID - 10.2169/internalmedicine.56.7593 [doi]
AB  - A 46-year-old woman with a history of Graves' disease presented with the chief
      complaints of appetite loss, weight loss, fatigue, nausea, and sweating. She was 
      diagnosed with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), thyroid storm, and influenza A. She
      was treated with an intravenous insulin drip, intravenous fluid therapy,
      intravenous hydrocortisone, oral potassium iodine, and oral methimazole. As
      methimazole-induced neutropenia was suspected, the patient underwent
      thyroidectomy. It is important to maintain awareness that thyroid storm and DKA
      can coexist. Furthermore, even patients who have relatively preserved insulin
      secretion can develop DKA if thyroid storm and infection develop simultaneously.

TI  - Humoral Hypercalcemia in Uterine Cancers: A Case Report and Literature Review.
PG  - 22-25
AB  - BACKGROUND Paraneoplastic hypercalcemia is a well-described complication
      associated with a variety of malignancies. However, its incidence in
      gynecological malignancies is low. CASE REPORT A 53-year-old woman presented with
      progressive abdominal distention and irregular vaginal bleeding of several weeks'
      duration. A contrast CT abdomen and pelvis was significant for a mass in the
      lower uterine/cervical region, multiple peritoneal and omental masses, enlarged
      pelvic and paraaortic lymph nodes, and large-volume ascites. A pelvic exam
      revealed a fungating vaginal mass, with biopsy showing a high-grade tumor with
      immunohistochemical staining positive for vimentin, CD10, and cyclin D1,
      consistent with endometrial stromal sarcoma. During her hospitalization, the
      patient became increasingly lethargic. Workup showed severe hypercalcemia and
      evidence of acute kidney injury. The patient did not have evidence of bony
      metastatic disease on imaging studies. Further laboratory evaluation revealed an 
      elevated PTHrP of 301 pg/mL (nl 14-27), a depressed PTH level of 3 pg/mL (nl
      15-65), and a depressed 25-OH vitamin D level of 16 ng/mL (nl 30-100), consistent
      with humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy. The patient was treated with
      pamidronate, calcitonin, and intravenous fluids. She eventually required
      temporary hemodialysis and denosumab for refractory hypercalcemia, which improved
      her electrolyte abnormalities and clinical status. CONCLUSIONS Uterine
      malignancies of various histologies are increasingly recognized as a cause of
      humoral hypercalcemia. They are an important differential diagnosis in a woman
      with hypercalcemia and abnormal vaginal bleeding or abdominal symptoms.

TI  - Delayed onset of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome in a case of
      scleroderma renal crisis with maintenance hemodialysis: Case report and
      literature review.
PG  - e5725
LID - 10.1097/MD.0000000000005725 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: In some cases, scleroderma renal crisis (SRC) is not easily
      distinguishable from other thrombotic microangiopathies such as thrombotic
      thrombocytopenic purpura, especially when the presentation includes neurological 
      or extra-renal manifestations. Here, we present a case of SRC who developed a
      rare neurotoxic complication, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome
      (PRES).A 36-year-old man with a history of diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis
      developed SRC and acute-on-chronic renal failure and ultimately required
      maintenance hemodialysis. Three weeks after starting hemodialysis, the patient
      presented with confusion and a new-onset seizure disorder. Laboratory
      examinations revealed thrombocytopenia, a low haptoglobin level, and schizocytes 
      on a blood smear. SRC-related PRES was considered first after PRES was confirmed 
      by brain magnetic resonance imaging. Antihypertensive therapy comprising
      captopril and amlodipine was administered, and the patient experienced a complete
      neurological recovery 3 days later without plasma exchange. In all previously
      reported cases of SRC-associated PRES, PRES developed before hemodialysis. Our
      report is, therefore, the first to describe a case of onset of SRC-related PRES 3
      weeks after the initiation of maintenance hemodialysis. CONCLUSION: This case
      demonstrates that microangiopathy and extra-renal manifestations can develop even
      in SRC patients with end-stage renal disease and that these manifestations can be
      successfully managed with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and
      aggressive blood pressure control. We recommend continuing ACEI therapy if
      elevated blood pressure persists after maintenance hemodialysis.

TI  - Rare presentation of subcapsular hepatic steatosis in a woman with uncontrolled
      diabetes without peritoneal dialysis: a case report.
PG  - 370
LID - 10.1186/s13256-016-1152-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Subcapsular hepatic steatosis is a rare atypical pattern of fatty
      deposition of the liver reported in patients with diabetic nephropathy receiving 
      peritoneal dialysis with intraperitoneal insulin. To date, there has been only
      one pediatric and zero adult cases of subcapsular hepatic steatosis with no
      history of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. We report the first
      published case of subcapsular hepatic steatosis in an adult diabetic patient
      without any history of peritoneal dialysis or evidence of chronic renal disease. 
      CASE PRESENTATION: A 46-year-old Caucasian woman with type 2 diabetes mellitus
      without renal disease presented to our emergency department with vague abdominal 
      symptoms and vomiting. Her blood glucose levels were poorly controlled with a
      range of 400 to 500 mg/dL. She was diagnosed as having subcapsular hepatic
      steatosis based on magnetic resonance imaging. Of note, after improved glucose
      control her subcapsular hepatic steatosis had nearly resolved. CONCLUSIONS:
      Subcapsular hepatic steatosis has been exclusively described in patients with
      continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis and those on intraperitoneal insulin,
      except for one pediatric case, which was probably due to incorrect insulin
      administration. Our case demonstrates that a diagnosis of subcapsular hepatic
      diagnosis should not be restricted to those getting continuous ambulatory
      peritoneal dialysis, but rather expanded to all patients with uncontrolled blood 
      glucose levels.

TI  - Olmesartan-induced Enteropathy Manifesting as Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome.
PG  - 3675-3678
AB  - Cases of sprue-like enteropathy associated with olmesartan have sporadically been
      encountered since it was first reported in 2012, and their most characteristic
      manifestation is severe diarrhea. We herein report the first case of sprue-like
      enteropathy manifesting as Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome due to vitamin B1
      malabsorption with only minimally increased bowel movements. When patients are
      receiving olmesartan and they complain of nonspecific chronic gastrointestinal
      symptoms, it is important to consider changing the drugs before any serious
      malabsorption syndrome develops.

PG  - 3607-3609
AB  - A 73-year-old man who had been transferred to our emergency room due to sudden
      chest pain was diagnosed with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).
      Primary percutaneous coronary intervention was performed. A long, white object
      which looked like a parasitic worm was retrieved via intracoronary aspiration and
      revascularization was successfully completed. Contrast computed tomography
      revealed a huge 7x6 cm mass in the right upper pulmonary lobe with direct
      pulmonary vein invasion. Histopathologic examination of the aspirated coronary
      object revealed pleomorphic lung carcinoma. This is an unusual case of STEMI
      caused by lung tumor embolization via direct pulmonary vein invasion to the left 
      side of the heart.

TI  - Spontaneous vertebral artery dissection with multiple supratentorial and
      infratentorial acute infarcts in the posterior circulation Case report.
PG  - 294-296
AB  - The article represents a case of a young patient with atypical clinical and
      paraclinical presentation of vertebral artery dissection by multiple cerebral
      infarcts, localized at the supratentorial and infratentorial levels in the
      posterior circulation. A case of a 21-year-old man, without a history of trauma
      in the cervical area or at the cranial level, without recent chiropractic
      maneuvers or practicing a sport, which required rapid, extreme, rotational
      movements of the neck, was examined. He presented to the emergency room with
      nausea, numbness of the left limbs, dysarthria, and incoordination of walking,
      with multiple objective signs at the neurological examination, which revealed
      right vertebral artery subacute dissection after the paraclinical investigations.
      The case was particular due to the atypical debut symptomatology, through the
      installation of the clinical picture in stages, during 4 hours and by multiple
      infarcts through the artery-to-artery embolic mechanism in the posterior cerebral
      territory. Abbreviations: PICA = posterior inferior cerebellar artery, CT =

TI  - Acute Transverse Myelitis Associated with Salmonella Bacteremia: A Case Report.
PG  - 929-933
AB  - BACKGROUND Acute transverse myelitis (ATM) is an uncommon and often overlooked
      complication of certain bacterial and viral infections that can have a rapid
      onset and result in severe neurological deficits. CASE REPORT This case report
      describes a previously healthy 28-year-old woman who presented to the trauma
      center after developing acute paralysis and paresthesias of all four extremities 
      within the span of hours. The initial presumptive diagnosis was spinal cord
      contusion due to a fall versus an unknown mechanism of trauma, but eventual
      laboratory studies revealed Salmonella bacteremia, indicating a probable
      diagnosis of parainfectious ATM. CONCLUSIONS This case illustrates the importance
      of considering the diagnosis of parainfectious ATM in patients presenting with
      acute paralysis with incomplete or unobtainable medical histories.

TI  - Pancreatic metastases from ocular malignant melanoma: the use of endoscopic
      ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration to establish a definitive cytologic
      diagnosis: a case report.
PG  - 332
AB  - BACKGROUND: When encountering solid pancreatic lesions, nonpancreatic primary
      metastases are rare and differentiating a metastasis from a primary neoplastic
      lesion is challenging. The clinical presentation and radiologic features can be
      similar and the possibility of a pancreatic metastasis should be considered when 
      the patient refers to a history of a different primary cancer. Endoscopic
      ultrasound offers a key anatomical advantage in accessing the pancreas and
      endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration has become the gold standard 
      method for diagnosing pancreatic lesions. CASE PRESENTATION: A 58-year-old white 
      Hispanic woman with a history of uveal malignant melanoma, presented with
      abdominal pain and jaundice. On admission, laboratory tests were performed (her
      total bilirubin was 6.37 mg/dL with a direct fraction of 5.30 mg/dL).
      Cross-sectional, abdominal computed tomography with contrast, showed a
      low-attenuating lesion localized in the pancreatic head (measuring 4 x 3 cm) and 
      a thinner section of the distal bile duct suspicious for compression. Our patient
      was scheduled for an endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration to
      establish a diagnosis. Endoscopic ultrasound showed a solid, hypoechoic,
      well-defined lesion with regular contours (measuring 3.17 x 2.61 cm), localized
      between the head and neck of the pancreas. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided
      fine-needle aspiration was performed with a 22G needle and cytology confirmed the
      diagnosis of metastatic melanoma. Our patient subsequently underwent right
      orbital exenteration, followed by duodenopancreatectomy without complications. At
      the moment our patient is receiving adjuvant chemotherapy at an outside oncology 
      clinic. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is a very rare
      presentation of an ocular malignant melanoma with an isolated pancreatic
      metastasis causing symptomatic biliary obstruction. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided 
      fine-needle aspiration has proven to be the best method to diagnose solid
      pancreatic lesions. In this particular case, cytology was essential in confirming
      the diagnosis and guiding the most adequate therapy, which was a pancreatic
      resection, ocular exenteration of the melanoma, followed by adjuvant
      chemotherapy.

TI  - Solitary Metastasis to a Distant Lymph Node in the Descending Mesocolon After
      Primary Resection for Hepatocellular Carcinoma: Is Surgical Resection Valid?
PG  - 909-915
AB  - BACKGROUND Lymph node metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma is rare, and lymph
      nodes located on hepatic hilar and hepatoduodenal ligaments are primary targets. 
      Metastasis to a mesocolic lymph node has not been reported previously. CASE
      REPORT A 65-year-old woman with liver cirrhosis underwent primary resection of
      hepatocellular carcinoma. Two and a half years later, tumor marker levels
      increased remarkably and imaging revealed a mesocolic mass. The tumor measured 27
      mm in diameter and showed characteristic findings consistent with hepatocellular 
      carcinoma in dynamic computed tomographic images, although the tumor was negative
      in fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomographic images. A
      preoperative diagnosis of solitary metastasis to a mesocolic lymph node was made,
      and we elected to perform surgical resection, although therapeutic strategies for
      rare solitary extrahepatic metastasis are controversial. The tumor was located in
      the mesocolon nearly at the wall of the descending colon. Curative resection was 
      performed and histopathological analysis confirmed metastatic hepatocellular
      carcinoma to a mesocolic lymph node. Tumor marker levels normalized immediately
      postoperatively. To date, the patient remains free from recurrence without
      adjuvant therapy. CONCLUSIONS This is the first known case of solitary
      hepatocellular carcinoma metastasis to a distant mesocolic lymph node,
      successfully treated. Diagnosing solitary hepatocellular carcinoma metastases to 
      distant lymph nodes can be difficult. Although the ideal therapeutic approach has
      not be defined, surgical resection of solitary metastatic lymph nodes may be
      beneficial in carefully selected cases.

TI  - Purtscher's retinopathy and renal cortical necrosis: two rare vaso-occlusive
      complications in a patient with acute pancreatitis: a case report.
PG  - 326
AB  - BACKGROUND: Purtscher's retinopathy and renal cortical necrosis are two rare
      vaso-occlusive complications of acute pancreatitis. Purtscher's retinopathy
      causes sudden impairment of vision, which was first reported in a patient with
      head trauma. Subsequently, it was also reported as a complication of acute
      pancreatitis and few other clinical conditions. Acute pancreatitis also rarely
      causes renal cortical necrosis leading to acute kidney injury. However, the
      simultaneous presence of both complications is rarely reported. CASE
      PRESENTATION: A 20-year-old Bengali man presented to our hospital with a history 
      of acute upper abdominal pain, vomiting, anuria, and disorientation. He was
      ultimately found to have bilateral complete blindness due to Purtscher's
      retinopathy and acute kidney injury due to renal cortical necrosis, as sequelae
      of acute pancreatitis. He became dialysis-dependent, his vision did not recover, 
      and he died 16 months after diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: This case highlights
      Purtscher's retinopathy and renal cortical necrosis might be considered as a
      recognized pair complication of acute pancreatitis.

TI  - Lead poisoning in a 16-year-old girl: a case report and a review of the
      literature (CARE compliant).
PG  - e4916
LID - 10.1097/MD.0000000000004916 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lead is a toxic element of the environment which leads to major
      complications once it enters the blood stream, affecting multiple organs and
      systems of the body. METHODS: We present the case of a 16-year-old girl,
      diagnosed with lead poisoning after occupational exposure due to the fact that
      the girl was actively involved in the family's pottery business.History revealed 
      that the girl participated in the process of pottery, her father was also
      diagnosed with lead poisoning 2 years before. The patient's personal history
      underlined that approximately 1 year ago she presented with severe abdominal
      pain, being diagnosed with acute appendicitis and she underwent appendectomy, but
      the pain persisted, thus due to family history of lead poisoning, the suspicion
      of saturnine colic rose, and she was diagnosed with lead poisoning. The main
      symptoms and signs were severe abdominal pain, vomiting, and arterial
      hypertension. The clinical evolution was favorable under symptomatic treatment
      and chelation therapy. RESULTS: Lead toxicity is a life-threatening condition
      because of its severe acute and chronic complications. In children, there is no
      safe blood lead level, prevention methods are, therefore, very important in order
      to avoid toxic multiorganic effects of this metal. CONCLUSION: Even though the
      diagnosis of lead poisoning remains difficult in children, it must also be taken 
      into consideration by the clinician facing a child with gastrointestinal or
      neurological involvement.

TI  - New Features of Electrocardiogram in a Case Report of Arrhythmogenic Right
      Ventricular Cardiomyopathy: A Care-Compliant Article.
PG  - e3442
LID - 10.1097/MD.0000000000003442 [doi]
AB  - Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is a crucial health
      problem. With sudden death often being the first presentation, early diagnosis
      for ARVC is essential. Up to date, electrocardiogram (ECG) is a widely used
      diagnostic method without invasive harms. To diagnose and treat ARVC as well as
      possible, we should clearly elucidate its pathophysiological alterations. A
      66-year-old farmer presented to the Emergency Department with continuous
      palpitation, chest tightness, profuse sweating, and nausea with no obvious
      predisposing causes. An ECG indicated ventricular tachycardia (VT). The patient
      experienced a sudden drop in blood pressure and acute confusion. After an
      immediate electrical conversion, his consciousness was gradually restored, and
      symptoms relieved. The patient was then transferred to the Department of
      Cardiology to receive ECG, echocardiography, coronary angiogram, biochemical
      assays, endocardiac tracing, and radiofrequency ablation. In the end, he was
      diagnosed with ARVC, evidenced by bilateral ventricle dilation and epsilon waves 
      in leads V1-V3. Appropriate therapies were provided for this patient including
      pharmacological intervention and radiofrequency ablation. Although the diagnosis 
      of ARVC is not difficult, this patient's ECG manifested several interesting
      features and should be further investigated: T wave inversions were found
      extensively in the anterior and inferior leads, revealing the involvement of
      bilateral ventricles; VTs with different morphologies and cycle lengths were
      found, and some VTs manifested the feature of irregularly irregular rhythm,
      reminding us to carefully differentiate some special VTs from atrial fibrillation
      (AF); and epsilon waves gradually appeared in leads V1-V3 and avR since the onset
      of ARVC. Most importantly, the epsilon waves behind QRS complex appeared in both 
      sinus rhythm and ventricular premature beats/VT originating from cardiac apex,
      whereas the epsilon waves prior to QRS complex occurred in VT originating from
      right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT). The features of T wave inversion and
      epsilon wave in ECGs and the appearance of VTs with different morphologies can
      reflect the progression of ARVC. The position relationship between epsilon wave
      and QRS complex in VT depends on ventricular activation sequence, that is, the
      localization of epsilon wave depends on where VT is originating from.

TI  - Synchronous malignancies of the gall bladder and common bile duct: a case report.
PG  - 106
LID - 10.1186/s12957-016-0848-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Synchronous malignancies of the gall bladder and common bile duct are
      a rare entity. Much of our knowledge on this topic comes from Japanese
      literature. Most of the synchronous carcinomas described in Japanese literature
      are associated with the presence of an anomalous pancreatic-bile duct junction
      (APBDJ). CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of synchronous malignancy of the
      extrahepatic biliary tree involving the fundus of the gall bladder and the
      intrapancreatic portion of the common bile duct (CBD). A 50-year-old female
      patient presented to us with clinical features of obstructive jaundice and on
      radiological evaluation was diagnosed to have a periampullary carcinoma; the
      patient underwent a pancreaticoduodenectomy, and histopathological examination
      revealed adenocarcinoma of the gall bladder and the intrapancreatic portion of
      the CBD. CONCLUSIONS: Synchronous malignancies have been rarely reported from the
      Indian subcontinent; therefore, it is essential for the clinician as well as the 
      pathologist to maintain a high index of suspicion while evaluating such lesions
      and to look for the presence of an anamolous pancreatic-bile duct junction
      whenever indicated.

PG  - 59
LID - 10.1186/s40463-015-0112-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant 
      disease that results in telangiectasia of the sinonasal tract, gastro-intestinal 
      tract as well as possible arteriovenous malformations of the lung, liver and
      brain. One of the most common disease manifestations of HHT is epistaxis. Severe 
      recurrent epistaxis necessitating iron therapy and blood transfusion is often
      managed with septodermoplasty. Its initial description was as an open surgical
      technique requiring nasal packing. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe a modified
      approach to septodermoplasty done completely endoscopically and without nasal
      packing for a patient with severe epistaxis due to HHT. CONCLUSION: The described
      technique modifications for the presented case allowed for same day discharge
      following surgery, complete take of the skin graft and resultant epistaxis
      control that ended thepatient's transfusion dependency. The merits of these
      modifications should be further evaluated in a clinical trial.

AB  - Achondroplasia is an autosomal dominant congenital disorder of enchondral
      ossification. It is clinically characterized by low stature, craniofacial
      deformity, and vertebral malformation. Associated ophthalmic features include
      telecanthus, exotropia, angle anomalies, and cone-rod dystrophy. A 24-year-old
      male presented with decreased vision bilaterally and typical achondroplasia. The 
      best corrected visual acuity was 20/70 in both eyes. Anterior segment examination
      was normal. Fundus examination revealed a well-demarcated circular paramacular
      lesion in both eyes. As macular coloboma and achondroplasia are developmental
      disorders, the funduscopic examination is required in patients with
      achondroplasia.

TI  - Pulmonary artery ablation to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension: a case
      report.
PG  - 284
LID - 10.1186/s13256-015-0768-4 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension is defined as a group of
      diseases characterized by a progressive increase in pulmonary vascular resistance
      that results in right heart failure and premature death. Although therapies exist
      to improve hemodynamic instability and symptoms, there is no cure for pulmonary
      arterial hypertension and it remains a life-threatening condition. A recent study
      performed in China reported, for the first time, the effect of pulmonary arterial
      denervation on functional capacity and hemodynamics in patients with refractory
      idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case
      of a 60-year-old white Brazilian man, with controlled hypertension and stage 2
      obesity who complained of progressive fatigue with moderate to light exertion of 
      approximately 1 year's duration. During this period, he underwent myocardial
      perfusion scintigraphy without evidence of obstructive ischemic disease. He had
      no clinical evidence of systolic heart failure. He had undergone biological
      mitral valve replacement 3 years previously for mitral valve stenosis and
      ablation of atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia 18 months previously. At
      the time of valve replacement, he had no reported evidence of pulmonary arterial 
      hypertension. His echocardiogram showed normal function of a mitral prosthesis,
      normal global left ventricular systolic function (left ventricular ejection
      fraction 62 % measured using the Teichholz method), stage I diastolic
      dysfunction, and a mean systolic pulmonary arterial blood pressure of 50 mmHg. In
      the 6-minute walk test, the patient walked 104 meters. Catheterization of his
      right heart chambers and pulmonary arteries confirmed the diagnosis of pulmonary 
      hypertension. Electroanatomic reconstruction of the right ventricular outflow
      tract and pulmonary artery was performed under direct fluoroscopic visualization,
      and a merger was made with a formatted image of cardiac computed tomography
      angiography. Then we performed irrigated cardiac catheter ablation of the
      pulmonary trunk. CONCLUSIONS: At the patient's 3-month follow-up, he showed
      improvement in functional class for fatigue on major exertion, increased distance
      walked in the 6-minute walk test, and reductions in pressure of both the right
      cavities and the pulmonary artery. Currently, with 6 months of clinical
      follow-up, the patient has maintained his functional classification and is
      pedaling his bicycle.

TI  - Mitral Perivalvular Leak after Blunt Chest Trauma: A Rare Cause of Severe
      Subacute Mitral Regurgitation.
PG  - 579-81
LID - 10.14503/THIJ-14-4439 [doi]
AB  - Blunt chest trauma is a very rare cause of valve disorder. Moreover, mitral valve
      involvement is less frequent than is aortic or tricuspid valve involvement, and
      the clinical course is usually acute. In the present report, we describe the case
      of a 49-year-old man with a perivalvular mitral injury that became clinically
      manifest one year after a violent, nonpenetrating chest injury. This case is
      atypical in regard to the valve involved (isolated mitral damage), the injury
      type (perivalvular leak in the absence of subvalvular abnormalities), and the
      clinical course (interval of one year between trauma and symptoms).

TI  - Cherubism With Bilateral Mandible and Maxilla Involvement: A Case Report.
PG  - e2120
LID - 10.1097/MD.0000000000002120 [doi]
AB  - Cherubism is a rare, nonneoplastic, self-limiting fibro-osseous that occurs in
      children. Affected children usually appear normal at birth. Lesions are
      characterized by the replacement of bone with fibrovascular tissue containing
      many multinucleated giant cells. Most studies have reported cherubism to be
      familial and with bilateral involvement of the mandibles. The authors describe a 
      nonfamilial case of cherubism, involving both the mandible and the maxilla, in a 
      4-year-old female child with slowly enlarging, painless, symmetrical swelling of 
      both cheeks.Cherubism is a rare disease that is usually limited to the mandible, 
      but the maxilla may be involved. Computed tomography scan and biopsy are helpful 
      for early diagnosis.

AB  - Mesenchymal chondrosarcomas are a rare variant of primary chondrosarcomas and can
      pose a diagnostic dilemma, especially when the features on conventional imaging
      are equivocal for an aggressive lesion. There is very little PET-CT experience in
      mesenchymal chondrosarcomas as per the literature and to the best of our
      knowledge, we are the first to describe a maxillary mesenchymal chondrosarcoma on
      PET-CT imaging. We report a case where PET-CT not only complemented conventional 
      imaging in suspecting a malignant osseous lesion, but also was indicative of the 
      grade of the tumor.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this case report was to highlight the importance of ruling 
      out pheochromocytoma in a patient with Von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL) and
      cardiovascular manifestations. CLINICAL PRESENTATION AND INTERVENTION: A
      22-year-old woman with type IIb VHL presented with signs and symptoms of acute
      decompensated heart failure. Transthoracic echocardiography showed a dilated left
      ventricle with severely depressed ejection fraction, confirmed by MRI. Urinary
      catecholamine and metanephrine tests had elevated levels and an abdominal MRI
      showed the presence of two cystic masses at the left hypochondrium. Surgical
      resection of both masses was performed, confirming the diagnosis of
      pheochromocytoma and clear cell renal carcinoma on histology. Six-month
      echocardiography showed a left ventricle with normal diameters and preserved
      ejection fraction. Genetic analysis revealed a germline mutation (exon 3 deletion
      of VHL). As there was no family history of VHL, it was determined to be a de novo
      mutation. CONCLUSION: This case report showed an atypical manifestation in a
      patient with VHL and underlines the importance of screening for pheochromocytoma 
      in such patients.

AB  - Circulating tumour DNA analysis can be used to track tumour burden and analyse
      cancer genomes non-invasively but the extent to which it represents metastatic
      heterogeneity is unknown. Here we follow a patient with metastatic ER-positive
      and HER2-positive breast cancer receiving two lines of targeted therapy over 3
      years. We characterize genomic architecture and infer clonal evolution in eight
      tumour biopsies and nine plasma samples collected over 1,193 days of clinical
      follow-up using exome and targeted amplicon sequencing. Mutation levels in the
      plasma samples reflect the clonal hierarchy inferred from sequencing of tumour
      biopsies. Serial changes in circulating levels of sub-clonal private mutations
      correlate with different treatment responses between metastatic sites. This
      comparison of biopsy and plasma samples in a single patient with metastatic
      breast cancer shows that circulating tumour DNA can allow real-time sampling of
      multifocal clonal evolution.

LID - 10.3350/cmh.2015.21.3.300 [doi]
AB  - Hepatoblastoma usually occurs in children under the age of 2 years, with very few
      cases reported in adults. We experienced a case of adult hepatoblastoma in a
      36-year-old female with chronic hepatitis B. She had experienced sudden onset
      abdominal pain. Her serum alpha-fetoprotein level was markedly elevated, and
      abdominal CT showed a 9-cm mass with internal hemorrhage in the right hepatic
      lobe with hemoperitoneum, so an emergency hepatic central bisectionectomy was
      performed. The initial histologic examination revealed that the mass mimicked
      combined hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma with spindle-cell
      metaplasia of the cholangiocarcinoma element. Follow-up abdominal CT performed 3 
      months later showed a 5.5-cm metastatic mass in the left subphrenic area.
      Laparoscopic splenectomy with mass excision was performed, and hepatoblastoma was
      confirmed histologically. A histologic re-examination of previously obtained
      surgical specimens also confirmed the presence of hepatoblastoma. Metastatic
      hepatoblastoma was found at multiple sites of the abdomen during follow-up, and
      so chemotherapy with cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), and vincristine was
      applied, followed by carboplatin and doxorubicin. Despite surgery and
      postoperative chemotherapy, she died 12 months after symptom onset.

TI  - Ivacaftor in a young boy with the rare gating mutation S549R--use of lung
      clearance index to track progress: a case report.
PG  - 123
LID - 10.1186/s12890-015-0120-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ivacaftor acts as a potentiator of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane 
      conductance regulator (CFTR) and increases the transepithelial chloride transport
      of CFTR in 9 of 10 known gating mutations causing cystic fibrosis. S549R is a
      rare gating mutation considered to be less sensitive to potentiators than all
      other gating mutations. CASE PRESENTATION: We report our first experience with
      ivacaftor in an 8-year-old boy with the rare S549R gating mutation. Besides
      subjective clinical improvements, the sweat chloride level and the lung clearance
      index decreased impressively within a few weeks of treatment while forced
      expiratory volume in the first second values remained in normal range.
      CONCLUSION: We emphasize the value of measuring small airway function by lung
      clearance index as an outcome measure for new interventions targeting the
      correction of the CFTR defect at an age before traditional lung function
      parameters start to deteriorate.

      NEOVASCULARIZATION IN RESPONSE TO ANTI-ANGIOGENIC TREATMENT.
PG  - 2260-4
LID - 10.1097/IAE.0000000000000846 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To use optical coherence tomography (OCT) angiography to monitor the
      short-term blood flow changes in choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in response
      to treatment. METHODS: In this retrospective report, a case of exudative CNV was 
      followed closely with OCT angiography over three cycles of antiangiogenic
      treatment. Outer retinal flow index, CNV flow area and central macular retinal
      thickness were measured. RESULTS: Quantitative measurements of CNV flow area and 
      flow index showed rapid shutdown of flow over the initial 2 weeks, followed by
      reappearance of CNV channel by the fourth week, preceding fluid reaccumulation at
      6 weeks. CONCLUSION: Frequent OCT angiography reveals a previously unknown
      pattern of rapid shutdown and reappearance of CNV channels within treatment
      cycles. OCT angiographic changes precede fluid reaccumulation and could be useful
      as leading indicators of CNV activity that could guide treatment timing. Further 
      studies using OCT angiography in short intervals between antiangiogenic
      treatments are needed.

PG  - 182
LID - 10.1186/s13000-015-0417-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We describe a case of renal carcinoid tumor with liver metastasis
      followed up postoperatively for 9 years. CASE PRESENTATION: A 33-year-old man
      presented with left flank dull ache. On the abdominal computed tomography, a
      solid renal mass in the upper portion of the left kidney was detected. The
      patient had no other abnormal findings, such as suspected distant metastasis or
      lymph node metastasis. Radical nephrectomy was performed on 14/9/2005.
      Histological examination and immunohistochemical staining confirm primary renal
      carcinoid tumor. 9 years after radical nephrectomy, computed tomography of the
      abdomen demonstrated a 2 cm x 1.8 cm cyst mass in the right liver. Similar
      pathologic characteristics were found between the renal carcinoid tumor and liver
      tumor. CONCLUSIONS: We present a primary renal carcinoid tumor with liver
      metastasis 9 years after radical nephrectomy. With literature review, renal
      carcinoid tumors exhibit heterogenous behavior.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pyogenic granuloma (PG) is a polypoid lobular capillary hemangioma
      rarely observed in the gastrointestinal tract. Only a few cases in the small
      bowel have been described in the literature. CASE PRESENTATION: A 58-year-old man
      had been suffering from general fatigue and severe anemia.
      Esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy did not reveal any significant
      bleeding. Abdominal computer tomography revealed a hypervascular tumor in the
      small intestine. Oral double-balloon endoscopy (DBE) detected a polypoid lesion
      (2 cm in diameter) in the jejunum. We performed laparoscopic-assisted partial
      resection of the jejunum. The histological features of the tumor were consistent 
      with PG. The patient's anemia gradually improved without the need for oral iron
      after surgery. CONCLUSION: In this case report, we present a case of pyogenic
      granuloma in in the jejunum that was detected by DBE.

      ulcerative colitis.
PG  - 151
LID - 10.11604/pamj.2015.21.151.6364 [doi]
AB  - Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) and Sweet's Syndrome (SS) are inflammatory skin
      diseases caused by the accumulation of neutrophils in the skin and, rarely, in
      internal organs. These neutrophilic dermatosis (NDs) are distinguished by the
      existence of forms of transition or overlap. They are frequently associated to
      systemic diseases especially hematologic and gastrointestinal ones. We report a
      case of a patient with ulcerative colitis (UC) who successively developed two
      types of NDs: PG then SS. A 66 years old patient with a history of UC consulted
      in July 2012 for an erythematous swelling of the back of the right hand treated
      with antibiotics without improvement. At that time, bacteriological samples were 
      negative. In October 2012, he was hospitalized for polyarthralgia and impaired
      general condition. In physical examination, he had vesiculobullous plaque of 10
      cm long of the right hand and wrist, infiltrated erythematous plaque on the right
      leg and another topped with a large pustule at the left ankle. Skin biopsy showed
      at the back of the right hand an aspect of PG and at the infiltrated plaques of
      the ankle an aspect of SS. Prednisone was started with improvement of the skin
      lesions and a recovery condition. The combination of PG and SS has already been
      described in cases of hematologic malignancy and rarely in UC. There is also the 
      notion of passage from a neutrophilic dermatosis to another. Indeed, a typical
      lesion initially of SS can evolve to a future PG. This case demonstrates that
      neutrophilic dermatoses form a continous spectrum of entities that may occur in
      UC.

TI  - Prolactin-producing pituitary adenoma with atypical spindle cell morphology: a
      case report.
PG  - 229
LID - 10.1186/s12957-015-0655-x [doi]
AB  - Reported herein is a 25-year-old woman who was treated for a large and highly
      atypical prolactin-producing pituitary adenoma. On presentation, she exhibited
      right hemiparesis and left-sided visual loss, associated with amenorrhea. A
      massive (>5 cm) intra- and suprasellar lesion was seen on imaging, and her serum 
      prolactin level was 4408 ng/ml. The patient received dopamine agonist treatment
      preoperatively for 4 weeks. To resect the tumor, a two-stage excision was
      required. Histologically, the specimen was composed of polygonal or spindle cells
      showing marked nuclear pleomorphism and/or multinucleation. Fibrosis was also
      focally conspicuous. Differential diagnoses included pituitary adenoma, pituitary
      carcinoma, pituicytoma, paraganglioma, spindle cell oncocytoma, and meningioma.
      Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells were positive for prolactin,
      chromogranin-A, and synaptophysin, but were negative for glial fibrillary acidic 
      protein, S-100 protein, epithelial membrane antigen, and vimentin. No apparent
      cerebrospinal or systemic metastases are found. Ultimately, prolactin-producing
      pituitary adenoma was diagnosed. Our case highlights the difficulty in
      definitively diagnosing an unusual prolactin-producing adenoma based on
      histopathology alone and the importance of referring to clinical information and 
      immunohistochemical findings when deriving the diagnosis.

TI  - Intradural prepontine chordoma in an 11-year-old boy. A case report.
PG  - 169-73
LID - 10.1007/s00381-015-2818-z [doi]
AB  - CASE REPORT: The authors report a case of an 11-year-old boy that presented with 
      headache and vomiting that was present for several months. CT and MR imaging
      revealed a large prepontine mass and an obstructive hydrocephalus. A
      ventriculoperitoneal shunt was inserted, and in a second operation, a
      radiologically proven total resection was performed, using a left frontotemporal 
      transsylvian approach. The tumour showed no involvement of the dura or clivus.
      Histological examination showed the characteristics of a chordoma. No further
      adjuvant treatment was given. The patient remained disease or tumour free after a
      6-year follow-up. DISCUSSION: Intradural chordomas are extremely rare tumours
      that originate from notochordal remnants. Only three other cases have been
      reported in the paediatric population. Ecchordosis physaliphora (EP) is an
      ectopic notochordal remnant that has a similar biological behaviour and is
      difficult to distinguish from intradural chordomas. They might exist in a
      continuum from benign notochordal tumour to malignant chordoma. A surgical
      resection without adjuvant radiation therapy is suggested to be the treatment of 
      choice in the paediatric population. CONCLUSION: The authors describe a rare case
      of an intradural prepontine chordoma in an 11-year-old boy that stayed disease
      free after a 6-year follow-up.

TI  - Colon perforation and Budd-Chiari syndrome in Behcet's disease.
PG  - 262-7
LID - 10.12659/AJCR.892757 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Behcet's disease is a chronic inflammatory disease involving multiple
      systems, with vasculitis being the most important pathological feature. Multiple 
      colon perforations are thought to be secondary to vasculitis and they occur in
      patients with ulcers. These may be encountered within the entire colon but most
      commonly in the ileocecal region. Intestinal perforation and Budd-Chiari syndrome
      are infrequent in Behcet's disease, and are associated with high mortality and
      morbidity. Budd-Chiari syndrome results from occlusion of either hepatic veins or
      adjacent inferior vena cava, or both. CASE REPORT: We report a patient with
      Behcet's disease having multiple perforations in the transverse colon, descending
      colon, and sigmoid colon. The patient also had Budd-Chiari syndrome due to
      inferior vena cava thrombosis extending into the right and middle hepatic vein.
      Our observations are presented with a review of the literature. CONCLUSIONS: In
      Behcet's disease, treatment of colon perforation necessitates urgent surgery,
      whereas management of Budd-Chiari syndrome is directed towards the underlying
      cause. Behcet's disease, as a chronic multisystemic disease with various forms of
      vasculitis, is resistant to medical and surgical treatment. Prognosis is worse in
      Behcet's disease with colon perforation than that in Budd-Chiari syndrome alone.

TI  - Myocarditis causing severe heart failure--an unusual early manifestation of
      leptospirosis: a case report.
PG  - 80
LID - 10.1186/s13104-015-1031-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is the most widespread zoonosis in the world. Cardiac
      involvement is a frequent complication of leptospirosis although significant left
      ventricular dysfunction is rare. We report a case of fatal leptospira myocarditis
      leading to cardiogenic shock on the second day of illness. This early occurrence 
      of myocarditis is not previously reported. CASE PRESENTATION: A 36-yr-old
      previously healthy Sri Lankan male who takes care of a horse presented to the
      medical casualty ward with a one day history of fever, arthralgia and severe
      myalgia. He developed hypotension on the second day of illness. Electrocardiogram
      showed sinus tachycardia with ST segment depression in lateral leads which
      evolved in to rapid atrial fibrillation in the subsequent days. 2D echocardiogram
      showed dilated cardiac chambers with severe global hypokinesia and an ejection
      fraction of 20%. His renal and liver functions were within normal limits. He
      developed multi organ dysfunction syndrome and refractory shock, later in the
      course of illness. Leptospirosis was confirmed by positive leptospira IgM and
      negative IgG. Patient died on the fifth day of illness despite optimal medical
      treatment with intravenous penicillin, meropenem, levofloxacin, inotropes and
      supportive care in the intensive care unit. CONCLUSIONS: We describe a rare and
      unusual early complication of leptospirosis which has not been reported before.
      It is important to bear in mind that leptospirosis could present as myocarditis
      during the early phase of illness.

AB  - A woman in her early 70s presented with chest pain, dyspnoea and diaphoresis 30
      min after her husband expired in our hospital. Cardiac markers were elevated and 
      there were acute changes in ECG suggestive for acute coronary syndrome.
      Echocardiogram showed apical akinesis, basal segment hyperkinesis with an
      ejection fraction of 30%. Cardiac catheterisation was performed showing
      non-obstructive coronary arteries, leading to the diagnosis of stress-induced
      cardiomyopathy. The patient improved with medical management. Repeat
      echocardiogram 2 months later showed resolution of heart failure with an ejection
      fraction of 65-70%.

TI  - Large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the lung presenting as pseudoachalasia: a 
      case report.
PG  - 56
LID - 10.1186/s13256-015-0514-y [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Pseudoachalasia is a rare disease that accounts for only a small
      percentage of patients with dysphagia. Neuroendocrine tumors are rare
      malignancies that most commonly originate within the gastrointestinal tract, with
      the next most common site being the lungs. Esophageal neuroendocrine tumors are
      the least common site within the gastrointestinal tract. Pseudoachalasia can be
      secondary to a malignant process within the body. Its typical characteristic in
      elderly patients is a short duration of symptoms with substantial weight loss.
      CASE PRESENTATION: A 68-year-old woman presented with worsening dysphagia that
      had started six months after the resection of a large cell neuroendocrine
      carcinoma of the lung in 2011. An extensive work-up in 2012, including
      esophagogastroduodenoscopy, chest computed tomography and positron emission
      tomography, was unremarkable. Esophageal manometries revealed findings
      characteristic of achalasia. A repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy in January of
      2014 revealed a nearly circumferential ulcerated, fungating mass in her distal
      esophagus. Biopsy results confirming a recurrence of her large cell
      neuroendocrine carcinoma. CONCLUSION: We report a case of pseudoachalasia due to 
      metastatic large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the lung. Our patient had an
      exceptionally prolonged duration of symptoms preceding the local esophageal
      recurrence, which was eventually revealed via endoscopy.

AB  - Cowden syndrome is an uncommon, autosomal dominant disease which is characterized
      by multiple hamartomas of the skin, mucous membrane, brain, breast, thyroid, and 
      gastrointestinal tract. The diagnosis of Cowden syndrome implicates an increased 
      risk of developing breast cancer. We report a case of a 22-year-old woman with
      Cowden syndrome that presented as breast cancer with concomitant bilateral
      exuberant benign masses in both breasts.

TI  - Role of 3D-CT for orthodontic and ENT evaluation in Goldenhar syndrome.
PG  - 283-7
AB  - Goldenhar syndrome is a congenital condition that includes anomalies of the
      derivatives of the first and second brachial arches, vertebral defects and ocular
      abnormalities. It is also known as oculo-auriculo-vertebrale syndrome (OAVS),
      hemifacial microsomia, or first or second brachial arch syndrome. It was first
      described by Van Duyse in 1882 and better studied by M. Goldenhar in 1952. Its
      treatment requires a multidisciplinary approach. Herein, we describe the value of
      3D-CT evaluation in a patient with Goldenhar syndrome, with particular regard to 
      planning diagnostic and therapeutic approach. A 7-year-old boy with Goldenhar
      syndrome with definite post-natal genetic diagnosis was referred to our
      Department of Radiology for neuroimaging of the temporal bone. By 3D-CT
      evaluation of this young patient we observed the asymmetry of the condyles with
      the right one dysmorphic, short and wide; the auricle of the right ear was
      replaced by a dysmorphic rough; the right middle ear had a hypoplastic tympanic
      cavity and the internal auditory canal of right ear was atresic. In our
      experience, 3D-CT is a powerful diagnostic instrument and offers many advantages:
      volumetric reproduction of cranium and soft tissues, no overlap of anatomic parts
      that limits the visibility of various structures, high precision and assurance of
      images, and a constant and easily reproducible reference system. In our case,
      3D-CT offered a very complete evaluation of all malformations of mandibular and
      temporal bone that characterize this syndrome and representing an important step 
      for ENT and orthodontic therapeutic approaches.

PG  - 8726-8
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v20.i26.8726 [doi]
AB  - We present a case of symptomatic perihepatic adhesions, which developed after a
      pregnancy complicated by hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelet
      (HELLP) syndrome, in which a subcapsular liver hematoma occurred. Our patient
      presented with complaints of persistent, severe right-sided upper abdominal pain.
      The complaints developed gradually, one year after a pregnancy that had been
      complicated by HELLP syndrome with a subcapsular liver hematoma. The hematoma had
      resolved spontaneously. An upper-abdominal magnetic resonance imaging revealed a 
      density between liver and diaphragm at the site of the former subcapsular
      hematoma, suspect of perihepatic adhesions. The presence of perihepatic adhesions
      was confirmed during a laparoscopy and treated by adhesiolysis in the same
      session. The adhesions may have developed in response to the degradation process 
      of the subcapsular liver hematoma during conservative treatment. This case of
      perihepatic adhesions may therefor be the first presentation of a long term
      sequel of subcapsular liver hematoma in HELLP syndrome.

AB  - Mitochondrial aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) are essential enzymes in protein
      synthesis since they charge tRNAs with their cognate amino acids. Mutations in
      the genes encoding mitochondrial aaRSs have been associated with a wide spectrum 
      of human mitochondrial diseases. Here we report the identification of pathogenic 
      mutations (a partial genomic deletion and a highly conserved p. Asp325Tyr
      missense variant) in FARS2, the gene encoding mitochondrial phenylalanyl-tRNA
      synthetase, in a patient with early-onset epilepsy and isolated complex IV
      deficiency in muscle. The biochemical defect was expressed in myoblasts but not
      in fibroblasts and associated with decreased steady state levels of COXI and
      COXII protein and reduced steady state levels of the mt-tRNA(Phe) transcript.
      Functional analysis of the recombinant mutant p. Asp325Tyr FARS2 protein showed
      an inability to bind ATP and consequently undetectable aminoacylation activity
      using either bacterial tRNA or human mt-tRNA(Phe) as substrates. Lentiviral
      transduction of cells with wildtype FARS2 restored complex IV protein levels,
      confirming that the p.Asp325Tyr mutation is pathogenic, causing respiratory chain
      deficiency and neurological deficits on account of defective aminoacylation of
      mt-tRNA(Phe).

AB  - Transcatheter aortic valve implantation, as well as interventional mitral valve
      repair, offer reasonable therapeutic options for high-risk surgical patients. We 
      report a rare case of early post-interventional aortic valve prosthesis migration
      to the left ventricular outflow tract, with paravalvular leakage and causing
      severe mitral valve regurgitation. Initial successful interventional mitral valve
      repair using a clipped edge-to-edge technique revealed, in a subsequent
      procedure, the recurrence of mitral valve regurgitation leading to progressive
      heart failure and necessitating subsequent surgical aortic and mitral valve
      replacement.

TI  - Clinical and transcriptional response to the long-acting interleukin-1 blocker
      canakinumab in Blau syndrome-related uveitis.
PG  - 513-8
LID - 10.1002/art.37776 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To report on the clinical response to canakinumab in a patient with
      sporadic nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 2
      (NOD-2)-associated pediatric granulomatous arthritis (Blau syndrome) and severe
      resistant panuveitis, and to describe gene expression profile changes throughout 
      such treatment. METHODS: A 4-year-old boy was diagnosed as having Blau syndrome
      on the basis of typical clinical features, histologic evidence of noncaseating
      granulomas, and a NOD2 mutation. Ocular involvement was initially controlled by
      topical and oral corticosteroids, but over the years visual impairment and
      complications, such as macular edema and retinal detachment, progressed. Ocular
      disease remained persistently active despite treatment with multiple different
      immunosuppressants; therefore, canakinumab treatment was started. Before and
      during the first 6 months of treatment, the gene expression profile was
      determined each month. RESULTS: Canakinumab treatment was well tolerated and led 
      to rapid quiescence of uveitis, which had been continuously active before this
      treatment. Gene expression profiling analysis of the patient's blood prior to
      initiation of interleukin-1 (IL-1) blockade revealed differential expression of
      1,993 transcripts when compared to healthy controls, and among the up-regulated
      transcripts, pathway analysis showed that the predominant network consisted of
      innate immunity-related transcripts. The transcriptional signature of the patient
      overlapped with the transcriptional signature of patients with systemic-onset
      juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and canakinumab treatment led to the normalization
      of most of these transcriptional changes. CONCLUSION: The pathogenesis of Blau
      syndrome may be mediated by IL-1, and canakinumab may be useful when this
      disorder is unresponsive to more conventional treatments.

LID - 10.1136/bcr-2012-006869 [doi]
LID - bcr2012006869 [pii]
AB  - Sweet's syndrome is a neutrophilic inflammatory dermatosis presenting with sudden
      onset tender red to purple papules and nodules, fever and neutrophilia.
      Gastrointestinal and urinary tract infections, pregnancy, inflammatory bowel
      disease, drugs and malignancy are some of the known aetiological factors.
      Paraneoplastic Sweet's syndrome accounts for 15-20% cases and thus forms an
      important subset. At times its onset helps in suspecting an underlying
      malignancy, thus making timely intervention possible. In the present case report 
      Sweet's syndrome was the presenting feature of gall bladder adenocarcinoma; an
      association that has been rarely reported before.

TI  - Postpartum HELLP syndrome--the case of lost battle.
PG  - 51-3
LID - 10.3109/03009734.2012.725431 [doi]
AB  - Unexpected rapid maternal death after delivery due to HELLP syndrome is rarely
      encountered and may become the subject of forensic expertise. Unexpectedness,
      suddenness, and fulminant course of this syndrome as well as absence of classical
      signs of pre-eclampsia can confuse physicians and lead to diagnostic delay. A
      definitive post-mortem diagnosis of HELLP syndrome in questionable cases of
      maternal death should be based on accepted laboratory criteria and characteristic
      histopathological alterations. We present a case of acute postpartum HELLP
      syndrome complicated by disseminated intravascular coagulation and acute renal
      failure which caused rapid maternal death only 20 hours after a caesarean section
      following an uncomplicated pregnancy.

LID - 10.1038/ejhg.2012.153 [doi]
AB  - We report a mutation in the anticodon of the tRNA(Arg) gene (m.10437 G>A),
      resulting in an anticodon swap from GCU to ACU, which is the anticodon of
      tRNA(Trp), in a boy with mitochondrial encephalomyopathy. Enzyme histochemical
      analysis of muscle tissue and biochemical analysis of isolated muscle
      mitochondria demonstrated cytochrome c oxidase (COX) deficiency. Restriction
      fragment length polymorphism analysis showed that 90% of muscle and 82% of
      urinary epithelium mtDNA harbored the mutation. The mutation was not identified
      in blood, fibroblasts, hair roots, or buccal epithelial cells and it was absent
      in the asymptomatic mother, suggesting that it was a de novo mutation.
      Single-fiber PCR analysis showed that the proportion of mutated mtDNA correlated 
      with enzyme histochemical COX deficiency. This mutation adds to the three
      previously described disease-causing mutations in tRNA(Arg), but it is the first 
      mutation occurring in the anticodon of tRNA(Arg).

AB  - Placement of the Avalon Elite bicaval dual lumen cannula for venovenous
      extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) via the internal jugular vein
      requires precise positioning of the cannula tip in the inferior vena cava with
      echocardiography or fluoroscopy guidance. Correct guidewire placement is clearly 
      the key first step in assuring proper advancement of the cannula. We report a
      case of unexpected wire migration into the right ventricle at the time of final
      cannula advancement, resulting in right ventricular rupture and tamponade.
      Transesophageal echocardiography is an important monitoring modality for
      appropriate placement of the VV-ECMO guidewire and Avalon cannula, and in
      particular, for early identification of potential complications.

TI  - Left atrial thrombus: a case report.
PG  - 417-8
AB  - RATIONALE: Echocardiography is essential in establishing the diagnosis in
      patients with cardiac masses. The differentiation between myxomas and thrombi is 
      sometimes difficult, but is critical in making the right therapeutical decision. 
      OBJECTIVE: A 70-year-old female presented to the Emergency Department with
      palpitations, dyspnea and anterior epistaxis. She had a 3 years history of atrial
      fibrillation and chronic heart failure NYHA class III. METHOD AND RESULT:
      Two-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography showed the thickening of the
      mitral valves with moderate mitral insufficiency and a mobile round mass in the
      left atrium, heterogeneous, inhomogeneous, 18 mm in size, attached with a narrow 
      stalk to the interatrial septum, reaching mitral annular plane; tricuspid
      insufficiency with a maximum 30 mmHg gradient, intact interatrial septum,
      akinesia of two thirds of basal inferior wall, 42% ejection fraction. DISCUSSION:
      The two-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography confirmed the intraatrial
      mass. Epistaxis was considered to be due to heart failure and the increased
      venous pressure. The patient was referred to the cardiovascular surgery clinic,
      but refused surgery. Anticoagulation with fraxiparine 0,6 ml/day was started and 
      continued for 3 weeks, after cessation of epistaxis by nasal tamponament. Then
      echocardiography was repeated, with no remnant mass in the left atrium. The
      conclusion was that the mass must have been a thrombus that has melted away. In
      this particular case, the left intraatrial thrombus may have been due to the
      presence of atrial fibrillation.

TI  - VACTERL association and mitochondrial dysfunction.
PG  - 192-4
LID - 10.1002/bdra.20768 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: VACTERL association includes the presence of malformations affecting 
      the vertebrae, anus, heart, trachea and esophagus, kidneys, and limbs. The causes
      remain largely unknown, but rare patients with mitochondrial dysfunction have
      been reported. Although clinical signs and symptoms consistent with possible
      mitochondrial disease are not uncommon in patients with VACTERL association, the 
      necessary testing to confirm mitochondrial dysfunction is infrequently performed.
      METHODS: We describe a patient with relatively classic signs of VACTERL
      association who had an onset of clinical signs of mitochondrial dysfunction at 13
      months of age. These signs included progressive muscle weakness, autonomic
      dysregulation, episodic hypoglycemia, and exocrine pancreatic dysfunction. The
      patient was later shown to have evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction (cytochrome
      c oxidase deficiency). CONCLUSIONS: Abnormal mitochondrial function may be
      associated with VACTERL association, and clinicians who encounter patients with
      VACTERL association should have a low threshold for considering mitochondrial
      dysfunction.

TI  - Case report. Gelastic seizures in a patient with right gyrus cinguli astrocytoma.
PG  - 433-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE AND IMPORTANCE: Gelastic seizure (GS) also known as "gelastic epilepsy"
      is a rare type of seizure associated with several different conditions such as
      tumors--hypothalamic hamartromas, tuberous sclerosis, hemangiomas, post
      infectious foci, cortical temporal dysplasia. We report one case of this rare
      condition generated by a right gyrus cinguli gr. II astrocytoma. CLINICAL
      PRESENTATION: A 27 year-old male, right handed, was admitted for a 2 years
      history of very frequent gelastic seizures accompanied sometimes by simple motor 
      partial seizures in both arms, more often being involved his left arm, without
      impairment of his consciousness state. His neurological examination was normal.
      Diagnosis was made on native CT scan: minimal hypodense frontal right paramedian 
      lesion, cerebral MRI showed a small well delimited right, parenchymal,
      homogeneous lesion (16/22/15 mm), involving gyrus cinguli, without perilesional
      edema and mass effect, hyperintense both on T1 and T2 MR sequences, non-enhancing
      after Gadolinium. The cerebral lesion was also documented on EEG and video-EEG
      recordings. Using an interhemispheric microsurgical approach, above the corpus
      callosum and the right pericallosal artery, at the level of gyrus cinguli, a
      yellow-gray, infiltrative tumor, having a moderate vascularisation, has been
      identified and totally removed. The anatomopathological analysis revealed a grade
      II astrocytoma. The patient recovered very well, without deficits, no gelastic
      seizures or epileptic manifestations; three months after operation he is still
      free of seizures. CONCLUSION: A case of gelastic seizures accompanied by simple
      motor partial seizures in both arms, without the impairment of his consciousness 
      state induced by a grade II right gyrus cinguli astrocytoma is described and
      documented by radiological and electrophysiological studies. Using microsurgical 
      resection, the tumor was totally removed, the patient clinical condition
      improved. Without an affective connotation as in temporal or hypothalamus
      topography, gelastic seizures are not patognomonic for hypothalamic hamartomas
      and in the case of frontal localization of the lesion; they can be associated
      with motor involvement of the limbs as in our case.

TI  - Pulmonary lymphangitic carcinomatosis from squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix.
PG  - 107
LID - 10.1186/1477-7819-8-107 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Pulmonary metastasis presenting as lymphangitic carcinomatosis
      arising from squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the cervix is a rare event. Poorly 
      represented in the literature, this event is associated with a) difficulty in
      accurate diagnosis, b) grave prognosis, and the c) lack of recognized
      predisposing risk factors. CASE REPORT: A 50 year-old female presented at our
      practice with a three-month history of a productive cough associated with
      dyspnoea and shortness of breath. A chest x-ray and computed tomography (CT) scan
      revealed multiple bilateral patchy areas with subsegmental atelectasis in both
      lungs which was investigated with a bronchoscopy, left thoracoscopy, and a left
      lung biopsy. Pathological examination of the wedge biopsy of the left upper lobe 
      revealed neoplastic sheets of cell disturbed along the septal vessels,
      perivascular/peribronchial lymphatics, and the subpleural lymphatics. This
      lymphangitic carcinomatosis was confirmed to be metastatic from SCC of the cervix
      that had been diagnosed and treated two years ago. She was treated with systemic 
      Carbo/Taxol chemotherapy and corticosteroids as a palliative measure. Despite
      temporary improvement, she died 13 months later. CONCLUSION: Pulmonary
      lymphangitic carcinomatosis is a rare manifestation of metastatic SCC of the
      cervix. As clinical presentations including radiographic imaging mimics other
      pulmonary entities, accurate diagnosis remains a challenge. Increased clinical
      awareness of such patterns of metastases in cervical cancer supported by accurate
      pathological diagnosis is imperative to guide appropriate therapy in these
      patients.

AB  - Leptomeningeal metastases (LM) occur in 5-10% of patients with solid tumors and
      are associated with a dismal prognosis. We describe LM from lung adenocarcinoma
      harboring a mutation in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene that
      confers sensitivity to the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) erlotinib 
      and gefitinib. The CSF concentration of EGFR-TKIs achieved by standard daily
      dosing may be insufficient for therapeutic effect. However, intermittent
      (pulsatile) high dose administration (1000-1500 mg/week) achieves a higher CSF
      concentration than standard dosing, and successfully controlled LM in this
      patient.

AB  - A 51-year-old man was referred to the Department of Cardiology in our hospital
      due to severe congestive heart failure and ventricular arrhythmias in March 2008.
      He had repeated ventricular tachycardia for years and the left ventricular
      ejection fraction (EF) was 11% on admission. A myocardial biopsy revealed that
      over 50% cardiomyocytes were replaced by fibrosis. Due to the typical acromegalic
      features, he was referred to the endocrinology department and diagnosed as
      acromegaly. He was treated with octreotide for 8 months followed by
      trans-sphenoidal surgery. The plasma levels of growth hormone (GH) and
      insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) decreased by octreotide and normalised by
      surgery after which the cardiac function improved drastically. The current case
      demonstrates that cardiac dysfunction in acromegaly could be recovered by
      normalisation of GH and IGF-1 even in the presence of severe fibrosis in the
      myocardium.

AB  - We report a case of gastric choriocarcinoma admixed with an alpha-fetoprotein
      (AFP)-producing adenocarcinoma. A 70-year-old man was hospitalized for gastric
      cancer that was detected during screening by esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD).
      Initial laboratory data showed the increased serum level of AFP and EGD revealed 
      a 5-cm ulcerofungating mass in the greater curvature of the gastric antrum. The
      patient underwent radical subtotal gastrectomy with D2 lymph node dissection and 
      Billroth II gastrojejunostomy. Histopathological evaluation confirmed double
      primary gastric cancer: gastric choriocarcinoma admixed with an AFP-producing
      adenocarcinoma and separated adenocarcinoma. At 2 wk postoperatively, his human
      chorionic gonadotropin and AFP levels had reduced and six cycles of adjuvant
      chemotherapy were initiated. No recurrence or distant metastasis was observed at 
      4 years postoperatively.

TI  - Unexplained liver laceration after metastasis radiofrequency ablation.
PG  - 5103-5
AB  - Many studies have established the role of radiofrequency (RF) ablation as a
      minimally invasive treatment for liver metastases. Although relatively safe,
      several complications have been reported with the increased use of RF ablation.
      We describe here a case of unexplained liver laceration after a RF procedure. A
      woman who presented a solitary metachronous liver metastasis underwent RF
      ablation treatment for this lesion. Six hours later the patient displayed fatigue
      and pallor. Emergency blood tests showed a haemoglobin level of < 7 g/dL and
      markedly elevated transaminase levels. A computed tomography examination revealed
      two areas of liver laceration with haematoma, one of them following the path of
      the needle and the other leading away from the first. Following a blood
      transfusion, the patient was haemodynamically stable and completely recovered 24 
      h later. The patient remained in bed for 1 wk. No surgical intervention was
      required, and she was discharged 1 wk later.

TI  - An unusual case of hypertensive diastolic heart failure with bilateral subclavian
      artery stenosis.
PG  - 111-2
AB  - Severe stenosis or occlusion of the subclavian artery is a rare clinical finding,
      even more so for bilateral existence of the condition. Subclavian artery stenosis
      and occlusion leads to erroneously low blood pressure values when measured at the
      brachial artery on the ipsilateral side. Widespread clinical reliance on a sole
      brachial measurement of blood pressure, particularly in the emergency room
      setting, may result in inappropriate clinical management in patients with
      conditions that alter brachial blood pressure. Currently, there is no published
      English-language literature on the implications of bilateral subclavian artery
      stenosis and occlusion in heart failure. A case of an apparently hypotensive
      patient with frequent emergency room visits for symptoms of heart failure
      exacerbation is presented.

TI  - A young man with acute dilated cardiomyopathy associated with methylphenidate.
PG  - 477-9
AB  - An 18-year-old obese man with a body mass index of 40, diagnosed with
      attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and treated with methylphenidate
      (Concerta) was acutely admitted to hospital with hypoxia and dyspnoea. On
      investigation signs of liver-, renal-, and heart-failure were found. Noradrenalin
      infusion was started. Echocardiography showed dilated left ventricle and an
      ejection fraction (EF) of 25%. Liver function improved, noradrenalin and
      dobutamine were tapered, but three days after admission a new echocardiography
      showed an EF of 10%. The patient was transferred to the National Hospital
      (Rikshospitalet, Oslo), where intensified treatment including intra aortic
      balloon pump (IABP) was instituted. Cardiac function improved, and 3 weeks later 
      the IABP was disconnected. EF at this point was 15%. The patient was denied heart
      transplantation due to various cofactors. The investigation concluded with a
      probable relationship between his cardiomyopathy and the use of methylphenidate
      (Concerta).

TI  - Langerhans cell sarcoma arising from Langerhans cell histiocytosis: a case
      report.
PG  - 577-80
AB  - Langerhans cell sarcoma (LCS) is a neoplastic proliferation of Langerhans cells
      that have overtly malignant cytologic features. It is a very rare disease and
      theoretically, it can present de novo or progress from an antecedent Langerhans
      cell histiocytosis (LCH). However, to our knowledge, LCS arising from an
      antecedent LCH has not been reported on. We present here a case of LCS arising
      from a pulmonary LCH. A 34 yr-old man who was a smoker, had a fever and a chronic
      cough. Computed tomographic (CT) scan revealed multiple tiny nodules in both
      lungs. The thoracoscopic lung biopsy revealed LCH. The patient quit smoking, but 
      he received no other specific treatment. One year later, the follow up chest CT
      scan showed a 4 cm-sized mass in the left lower lobe of the lung. A lobectomy was
      then performed. Microscopic examination of the mass revealed an infiltrative
      proliferation of large cells that had malignant cytologic features.
      Immunohistochemical stains showed a strong reactivity for S-100 and CD68, and a
      focal reactivity for CD1a. We think this is the first case of LCS arising from
      LCH.
