# Automated-ICD10-Codes-Assignment

This repository contains all the code related to my research at UCLA. My research was focused on 1) Automatically assigning ICD-10 codes for a medical report and 2) predict missing ICD-10 codes for a medical report

The first half of my research involved a lot of text cleaning and SQL queries to find a mapping between various entities in the medical code system. The most exciting aspect about this half was developing an algorithm to assign context-aware ICD-10 codes. I used concepts from graph theory to do this.

The second half of the project was primarily focused on examining and potentially completely solving the link prediction problem over weighted bipartite graphs. I extensively studied literature on user-item recommendation systems. At the end, I experimented with matrix factorization methods and item-based collaborative filtering techniques. Neither gave satisfactory results (with the item-based collaborative filtering giving incorrect results at times) and I plan to resume working on this soon.
